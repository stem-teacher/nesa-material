# Data Science 2 in Context
§	Use data to make evidence-based decisions about a familiar issue and assess the implications of these decisions


# Task Goal
To prepare a series of Data Science lessons for students in Years 7-10 as part of the preparation for the adoption of an updated Year 7-10 curriculum.

# Constraints & Considerations
1. Lessons must suitable for casual teachers -  something they can pickup and deliver with ease. Casual teaching cohort cannot be assumed to have strong computer skills with data science is generally being new content.
2. Lessons must trace against stated syllabus (Attached, along with the prior text books for context)
3. The set of lessons must support progression of different skills as students mature.
4. Any technology used must be available to NSW schools, and easily supported.
5. Initial technology should be simple (say Excel / Google Sheets), but broadly expand over time.
6. Acquiring relevant data sets / is an important consideration
7. From an industry perspective visualisations are key to also serve the need to support communication requirements.
8. Lessons should have appropriate diagnositic and summative assessment approaches.
9. Obviously the more interesting the lessons, the better it will be received by teachers.
10. AI technologies are clearly improving rapidly in these areas. However,  AI adoption in a Public School environment  will not occur at the same rate as in industry. Thus there needs the mechanism to generate lessons so they can be run in isolation.
11. As the area is updating quickly, it will make sense to keep the overall approaches in the context of open source tooling.
12. The approach should incorporate pragmatic pedagogy to Data science that develops over time, yet show that even more basic techniques such as frequency distributions  can be useful.
13. Educational language. Language as used in NSW Education such as the use of Line Chart versus scatter  plot should be used.


# Data Sets
Data sets will perhaps drive what can be analysed and presented. Thus, for each of the class areas relevant data sets, preferably from Australian sources should be found.
Example Data Sets include:
https://oceantracks.org/library


## Modelling
Some of the lessons should have appropriate models, to support emphasing teaching outcomes.

## Approaches in the life of practical teaching
Lack of teacher preparation time is a significant consideration. The lessons should be able to skimmed and read with minimal fuss.

## Technology Options & Support
### Excell / Google Sheets
Excel / Google Sheets is an available technology, and to some extent needs to be understood, on the other, in practice the approach will increasingly become obsolete over time.

### Concord.org / codap
The site https://codap.concord.org/educators/ & other https://concord.org sites have a range of reasonable tools, along with many educational examples. The main down side is that it isa bit US centric and the tooling is not general.

###  NoteBooks
1.  The school has acess to Google Colab.
2. Australian Researchers cna gain access to public https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/ardc-jupyter-notebook-service/
3. https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws
Workbook technologies such as Jupyter / Observable Notebooks provide mechanism to have more sophisticated analysis along with keeping a history of activities,. The
4.  Observable notebooks

Perhaps lessons could be scripted in notebook.

### AI Integration with An ap.
While chatbot AI has limiotations, perhaps custom chatbots / speach.
The lesson can have its own AI chat robot to help assist with the students answer ing questions.
Emerging technologies from open AI & Anthropic have increasingly sophisticated data science capabilliteis.

### Concord.org/CODAP

The site [CODAP](https://codap.concord.org/educators/) and other tools available at [Concord.org](https://concord.org) offer a range of reasonable tools along with many educational examples. The main downside is that it is a bit US-centric, and the tooling is not general.

Notebook technologies, such as Jupyter and Observable Notebooks, provide mechanisms for more sophisticated analysis while keeping a history of activities.

### AI Integration with an App

While chatbot AI has limitations, custom chatbots or speech-based systems could be useful. Lessons can have their own AI chatbot to assist students in answering questions. Emerging technologies from OpenAI and Anthropic increasingly offer sophisticated data science capabilities.

3. **Engagement**:
   - Are the lessons designed to be interesting and engaging for both students and teachers?
   - Do they effectively use visualisations and practical applications to enhance learning?

4. **Assessment**:
   - Are diagnostic and summative assessment approaches integrated into the lessons?

5. **Sustainability**:
   - Is the approach future-proofed to accommodate advancements in data science and AI technologies?
   - Does the use of open-source tools provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness?

6. **Feasibility**:
   - Are the datasets relevant, easily accessible, and appropriate for the learning objectives?
   - Are the lessons designed to be prepared and delivered with minimal time and effort by teachers?

7. **Technology Readiness**:
   - Is there a clear plan to transition from simpler tools (e.g., Excel) to more advanced platforms (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks)?
   - Are emerging AI technologies integrated thoughtfully without over-reliance?

By addressing these criteria, AI tools or reviewers can evaluate the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of the lesson plans and associated technologies.

# Task Goal

I am looking to prepare a series of Data Science lessons for students in Years 7-10 as part of the preparation to build sets of staff resources for the adoption of an updated Year 7-10 curriculum in the new NSW High School Curriculum

I am trying to think through the best type of technology tooling, that will set the students up for life, and not be insanely backwards.

On the one hand, some of the data requirements are very simple and can be reasonably taught using a spreadsheet.

However, as lessons progress, a more notebook style interface such as represented by Jupitter and observable notebooks might be more appropriate.

Finally, the differenent AI vendors are all introducing canvas style tooling - could this work, either as a direct interface, or something that a notebook interface links tool.
