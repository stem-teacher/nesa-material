Transcript

The *Science 7–10 Syllabus* prioritises the development of students' scientific literacy. Students learn through observation, experimentation, critical analysis and creative thinking and are equipped with the tools required to investigate phenomena, make predictions and solve problems.

The syllabus has been developed using evidence-based research.

Clear, concise language identifies the key concepts, knowledge and skills for all learners.

The syllabus integrates knowledge and skills across different science disciplines. This enables students to make connections and deepen their scientific understanding. Topics such as data science, pseudoscience and climate change emphasise ethical evidence-based decision-making and provide strong alignment between science and mathematics.

The inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander scientific Knowledges and Cultural Practices provides opportunities for students to learn about the oldest continuing living Cultures in the world.

The syllabus highlights real-life applications of science that encourage students to explore relevant contexts. The inclusion of Depth Studies provides students with the opportunity for deeper learning in areas of personal interest.
