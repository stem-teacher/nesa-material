# Purpose

The depth study guide is designed to support the teaching of the *Science 7–10 Syllabus* (2023). It aims to convey information, resources and teaching advice relating to depth studies. Some students with disability may require [adjustments](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/adjustments) to access scientific investigations and engage in Working scientifically processes.

A depth study is any type of scientific investigation that provides students with an opportunity to pursue their interests and deepen their scientific understanding of one or more focus areas. Depth studies may be completed individually or collaboratively. Students are encouraged to reflect on their learning by developing a portfolio of work to demonstrate their Working scientifically processes. 

Students are required to undertake at least one depth study every year in Stages 4 and 5. Students undertaking Life Skills in Science 7–10 have the option to engage in a depth study. Information relating to the course requirements can be found in the [Science 7–10 Overview](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/overview).

A student\'s level of engagement with depth studies should provide evidence of learning in relation to outcomes and can help teachers to make judgements about student progress and achievement. There is no requirement for depth studies to be assessed as standalone assessment tasks or in any particular way. 

Depth studies provide opportunities for students to:

-   plan and conduct investigations and analyse the results of the investigations in a scientifically robust manner

-   develop understanding of the conventions for representing information in visual forms to convey the planning, results and analyses of investigations

-   develop and apply skills in evaluating secondary sources.

Schools are required to ensure they follow [safety and risk management, including the welfare of animals](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/about-the-curriculum/safety-and-risk-management), in delivering the *Science 7–10 Syllabus*. delivering the *Science 7–10 Syllabus.* .

# Depth study planning

Considerations for depth study planning may include:

-   student interest, background and local context

-   scaffolding, such as planning prompts, checklists and mind maps

-   individual or collaborative investigation

-   extension opportunities

-   [adjustments](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/adjustments) to support some students with disability

-   encouraging EAL/D learners to access linguistic supports and use their home language or dialect when generating ideas and planning for depth studies.

The following checklist may be used by teachers planning a depth study for students.

-   Select one or more focus areas as relevant to the depth study.

-   Indicate on the scope and sequence where the depth study has been included.

-   Select at least 2 Working scientifically processes to be included.

-   Consider the equipment and resources available.

-   Select the [investigation](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/teaching-and-learning) type – either practical or secondary sourced.

-   Complete a risk assessment and follow ethical guidelines for the investigation.

-   Determine the ways in which students may document their learning, such as with a poster, presentation or written report.

-   Clarify the ways in which secondary sources should be referenced.

# Depth study samples

Two sample depth studies have been provided – one for Stage 4 and one for Stage 5. These depth studies are designed to be completed in 5 hours of class time and are aligned to the NSW *Science 7–10 Syllabus* (2023). They provide meaningful opportunities to engage with key concepts in the syllabus and develop Working scientifically process skills.

The samples show practical depth studies aligned to a focus area with aligned Working scientifically processes.

-   The Stage 4 sample, 'Health of a local habitat', provides an opportunity for students to pursue their interest and develop skills in investigating local habitats.

-   The Stage 5 sample, 'Comparing efficiency of fuels', provides an opportunity for students to pursue their interest and develop skills in investigating alternatives to derivatives of crude oil. This depth study provides an opportunity for students to broaden or extend their learning beyond focus area content.

| **SC4-CLS-01** describes the unique features of cells in living things and how structural features can be used to classify organisms | The purpose of this depth study is for students to investigate the health of a local habitat such as a creek. Students identify organisms using keys, collect qualitative and quantitative observations about the biotic and abiotic features of the habitat, and identify adaptations that enable organisms to survive in this environment. Students could communicate with local groups to inform their assessment of the health of the chosen habitat and to discuss possible solutions and recommendations for maintaining and/or improving the health and useability of the area. Groups could include Bushcare, NSW Waterwatch, local councils and Local Aboriginal Land Councils. This depth study provides an opportunity for students who are interested in this topic to apply focus area content to a local context. |

| **SC5-MAT-01** assesses the uses of materials based on their physical and chemical properties                                              | The purpose of this depth study is to extend students' understanding by guiding them through an investigation of alternative fuel sources and an assessment of the efficiency of these fuels compared to traditional octane-based fuel. Students design and conduct investigations to compare the amount of energy released by different fuel sources. They use secondary data to evaluate the efficiency of the fuels and present scientific arguments about the suitability of the biofuels as alternatives to traditional octane-based fuel. This depth study provides an opportunity for students who are interested in this topic to extend their learning beyond focus area content. |

The teacher discusses the documentation with students to identify students needing consolidation of prior learning or further examples to support next steps in their learning. Students collaborate with peers to share their written reports or digital documents, providing informal peer feedback about the process of investigating the efficiency of E10 and other biofuels. Students use the peer feedback to self-evaluate and refine their judgements. |                                                                                                |
