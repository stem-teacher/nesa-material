# Purpose

The Science 7–10: Data science guide is designed to support the teaching of the *Science 7–10 Syllabus* (2023). It is intended to convey information, resources, teaching advice and conventions relating to data science.

Data science is the process of analysing data from investigations in order to identify connections and trends which can be used to make informed predictions.

In the *Science 7–10 Syllabus* (2023, data science focus areas provide opportunities for students to participate in experiences that develop their scientific knowledge and capabilities. Students develop an understanding of the social and cultural contexts of science in order to make reasoned, evidence-based and ethical decisions.

Data science encourages students to find innovative solutions to science-related social and global issues, including sustainable futures. Through these focus areas, students generate and analyse data, evaluate results and make ethical, evidence-based decisions, as informed, reflective and scientifically literate citizens.

# Data science cycle

![Data science cycle represented by labelled rings; details below.](media/image2.png){width="4.504767060367454in" height="2.5453477690288713in"}

*Figure 1: Diagram of the data science cycle*

*Image long description:* Five interlocking rings representing the data science cycle: the first ring in the link is labelled 'Question' and contains the image of a speech bubble with a question mark inside; the second ring is labelled 'Collect' and contains the image of a container with four boxes with tick marks; the third ring is labelled 'Process' and contains an image of 3 arrows pointing clockwise in a circular shape; the fourth ring is labelled 'Analyse' and contains the image of a bar graph with a line above it indicating that it is trending upwards; and the fifth ring is labelled 'Communicate' and contains the image of a light bulb.

The data science cycle involves 5 key steps:

-   **Questioning:** The process begins with a question related to an area of interest or a problem that needs solving. For example, 'How does daily temperature change over the course of a week?'

-   **Collecting data:** In Stage 4, data might be collected as a class from an experiment or investigation, for example by recording the daily temperature at the same time each day for a week. In Stage 5, large datasets might be used, such as those available from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) which provide information on atmospheric data, including temperature, humidity, air purity, particulates, ozone levels, and more.

-   **Processing data:** Collected data is organised it so that it makes sense. This could involve transferring the data into tables or using spreadsheets to arrange the information. Organising data helps in identifying patterns or trends more easily.

-   **Analysing data:** The data is examined closely to find answers to the original question. Calculating the mean (average), mode (most common value) or range (difference between the highest and lowest values) can provide insights. Graphs or charts can also be created to visually represent the data, making it easier to understand what the data reveals.

-   **Communicating:** The final step is to communicate the findings. This includes explaining the insights gained and suggesting actions based on the data. For example, if the data shows patterns in daily temperature changes it might be important to explain what factors could be influencing these changes. Clear communication ensures that others can understand and act on the findings.

> [Data classification and visualisation](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-k-10-2022/content/stage-4/fa1961f47c) is a core component of the [*Mathematics K–10 Syllabus*](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-k-10-2022/overview) (2022).

It is important to remember that this process is not linear; it is a cycle. If the analysis brings up new questions, or if more information is needed, it may be necessary to revisit the data, or collect new data, to continue exploring the question.

**Data science** **1**

This table demonstrates the way that Data science 1 can be taught in the context of bushfire prevention, detection and management. Teachers should be aware of the sensitive nature of the topic of bushfires. Friends, family and property of students may have been affected by bushfires. Teachers should plan for **10 weeks** or **one term** of school time to teach the focus area Data science 1.

The Data science 1 focus area can be taught alongside other focus areas, and aligned to students' interests, local contexts or the school environment.

This creates a digital footprint. Students can learn about the importance of sharing accurate information online as spreading false data can cause unnecessary panic or mislead people during emergencies. | The teacher could provide social media posts that are related to a recent NSW bushfire for students to analyse. Students identify reliable sources of data versus potentially misleading sources. They could create a classroom guide on how to verify information before sharing it, emphasising the importance of digital responsibility during emergencies. |

## Stage 4 – Data science 1: class dataset suggestions

The datasets resulting from these investigations should be large enough to require analysis tools to calculate the mean, median, mode and range, and to support the representation of data graphically. The dataset can be univariate (one variable) or bivariate (2 variables), depending on the question that is being investigated.

**Univariate**

-   Fieldwork, including data collected using transects

-   Number/type of pets for each student

-   Number of siblings for each student

-   Number of bush foods or native vegetation found on school grounds

-   Method of transport to school for each student

-   Distance travelled to school, including data collected using an online mapping tool

-   Heart/breathing rate for each student

-   Lung capacity for each student, including data collected by a spirometer or the displacement method

-   Grip strength for each student

-   pH of soil at sites around the school

**Bivariate**

-   Shoe length/height

-   Outside temperature 24h/week, including data collected using data loggers or thermometers

-   Heart rate after running different distances

-   Impact of traditional Aboriginal fire management techniques on the health of local vegetation

-   Local air quality over time

-   Accuracy of basketball/netball shots depending on the distance from a hoop/ring

-   Lung capacity compared to student height

-   Noise levels in the classroom over time

## Worked example for class data collection

Students could use the following experiment to investigate the relationship between the accuracy of basketball shots and the distance from a hoop. They could analyse the data manually or by using a digital spreadsheet.

**Aim**

To investigate any association between the 2 variables: the accuracy of basketball/netball shots (dependent variable) and the distance from a hoop (independent variable).

**Apparatus**

-   Basketball/netball

-   Basketball hoop/netball ring

-   Metre ruler/tape measure/trundle wheel

-   Chalk

**Method**

1.  Set up the experiment area by using the metre ruler to draw chalk lines at 1.5 m, 3.0 m, 4.5m, 6.0 m and 7.5 m intervals from the basketball hoop/netball ring.

2.  From each marked distance, a student will take 10 shots at the basket, and record the number of successful shots at each distance.

3.  Repeat step 2 for each student.

4.  All student data is collated into a spreadsheet.

5.  The mean, median, mode and range of shot accuracy is calculated for each distance.

6.  A scatter plot of shot accuracy against distance is created.

**Results**

A sample set of class results has been included in [a worked excel spreadsheet](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/teaching-and-learning) called 'Sample spreadsheet: Science Stage 4 – Data science 1'.

The spreadsheet includes calculations for mean, median, mode, range and accuracy.

Scatter plots for each student and accuracy have been generated for each distance.

## Stage 5 – Data science 2: data analysis of a large dataset (CSIRO Sydney particle study)

### Content from 'Large datasets and scientific argumentation'

-   Outline the features, collection, uses and applications of large datasets

-   Use available large datasets to develop and test a question

-   Conduct a descriptive analysis of a large dataset

-   Conduct a univariate analysis and a bivariate analysis using large datasets

-   Recognise the difference between causal and correlational relationships

### Using large datasets

The use of large datasets in science has increased significantly over the last 20 years as technological developments have allowed scientists to generate large volumes of data relatively quickly; allowing scientists to investigate increasingly complex questions.

Student-generated datasets (i.e. primary data), using data loggers and sensors, may be used to generate large datasets.

Many large datasets produced by researchers (i.e. secondary data) are available online. A list of publicly accessible websites is included in Suggested resources and will allow students to investigate a range of questions that may be of interest or directly relevant to their context.

Large datasets require the use of digital spreadsheet applications.

![A labelled box plot with a scale from 0–100. Details below.](media/image4.png){width="3.490566491688539in" height="3.66080927384077in"}

*Figure 2: Diagram of a box plot*

*Image long description*: A diagram of a box plot showing the median point of data collected, the upper and lower quartile and quartile extremes. The whisker, which is the difference between the lower quartile and lower extreme, is labelled. An outlier, which is a point outside the extreme, is also labelled. The scale of the graph is measured 0 to 100.

In this example, data from the [Sydney particle stud](https://www.csiro.au/en/education/Resources/Educational-datasets/Sydney-Particle-Study)y has been used, and sample data analysis has been used, and sample data analysis has been performed (see [Dataset source and analysis: Science Stage 5 [–]{.underline} Data science 2](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/teaching-and-learning) included). The variable of interest is the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere over a 2-week period (from 7/2/2011 to 20/2/2011).

### Options for analysis

**Univariate analysis** investigates the data for one variable. For this example, the variable is the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere.

Univariate descriptive statistics include:

-   measures of central tendency/measures of centre

-   mean

-   median

-   mode

-   measures of variability/spread

-   standard deviation

-   range

-   quartiles and interquartile ranges (in context)

-   visualised using box plot (in context) which includes t[he minimum value, the lower quartile, the median, the upper quartile and the maximum value]{.mark}.

![A box plot of ozone concentration with a scale from 0–70 ppb and 7 outlier points. Details below.](media/image5.png){width="5.134747375328084in" height="3.6287128171478567in"}

*Figure 3: Box plot of ozone concentration*

*Image long description:* The graph shows the range of ozone concentration in parts per billion. The median is labelled with an 'x' and the upper and lower quartiles are shown along with the extremes. There are 7 outlier points shown in the graph.

**Bivariate analysis** compares 2 variables to investigate any association between them to answer a specific question. Examples of questions that compare 2 variables could include:

-   Does the concentration of ozone vary between times of day? (Variables are 'concentration of ozone' and 'date/time'.)

-   Is there an association between the concentration of ozone and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere? (Variables are 'concentration of ozone' and 'concentration of NOx'.)

-   Is there an association between the concentration of ozone and wind speed? (Variables are 'concentration of ozone' and 'wind speed'.)

-   Is there an association between the concentration of ozone and temperature? (Variables are 'concentration of ozone' and \'temperature'.)

Bivariate descriptive statistics are visualised with a scatter plot to identify any association between the 2 variables. Where there is an association, students can describe the association in terms of form (e.g. linear association), strength (e.g. strong, moderate or weak), and direction (e.g. positive or negative).

Examples of sample scatter plots can be found in the [Data science 2 sample spreadsheet](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/teaching-and-learning).
