# Data representation 7–10

Data is information that is collected, organised and analysed for various purposes. The ability to collect, organise, interpret, represent and analyse data is important for informed decision-making, problem-solving and critical thinking.

Data representations are different ways of organising and displaying data. A data representation can be in the form of numbers, text and/or images. Data representations enable the analysis and evaluation of data. Different methods of representing data can help visualise or interpret data based on the focus of analysis and/or evaluation.

Two common methods of data representation are data displays and statistical measures. Data displays are visual formats for organising, representing and summarising data. Data displays are also referred to as visualisations. Statistical measures are numerical values that summarise a dataset. They provide a way to describe the characteristics of a group of data points.

Across the 7–10 curriculum, students may be required to both interpret and produce data representations for a range of purposes and across different contexts.

## Data quality and integrity

When teaching students about data representations, it is important to consider the quality and the integrity of the data used to form the representation.

To ensure accurate and meaningful data representation and analysis, the following should be considered.

**Accuracy**

Data should be correct and free of errors. Students should understand the importance of verifying that the data they are using, or the representation they are interpreting, accurately reflects findings and has not been altered or misrecorded.

Data accuracy includes considerations of data completeness. Students should check that datasets are complete and be aware of the impact of missing values. When generating their own data representations, students should present data in a way that avoids distortion or misleading interpretations.

**Bias and objectivity**

Students should be aware of and address potential biases in data collection or analysis and ensure that the data is presented objectively.

**Consistency**

Data should be consistent across sources or formats to allow for accurate representations. Mismatched units of measurement will result in flawed data representations.

**Data privacy**

Integrity also involves ethical considerations. If applicable, students may explore the importance of data privacy and ethical considerations when working with sensitive information.

**Data validation**

Students should evaluate the reliability and credibility of the data source to ensure accuracy. Reliable data comes from credible, accurate and unbiased sources.

**Identifying anomalies**

Students need to be able to recognise and address unexpected or inconsistent data points.

## Supporting diverse learners

Data tables and graphs are powerful tools for communicating information, however they can present challenges for some learners who may require additional support to access, organise and understand information presented.

Considerations for teaching may include:

-   explicitly teaching vocabulary related to data representation

-   providing examples linked to student knowledge, experiences and interests

-   providing high-resolution visuals that incorporate lines of sufficient thickness

-   simplifying details and incorporating high-contrast clear images

-   incorporating tactile graphics

-   presenting data using 3D models or tactile objects

-   using a screen reader, an assistive technology that reads on-screen elements as text-to-speech

-   providing audio descriptions, or using electronic resources that can be read by screen readers

-   annotated examples and non-examples to identify elements of effective data representation

-   providing checklists and prompts to guide the processes of data collection and organisation

-   providing scaffolds, including sentence starters and planning frameworks, to support interpretation of data

-   guiding students to apply examples of data representation to demonstrate their understanding.

Some students with disability may require [adjustments](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/adjustments) to engage with various forms and methods of data representation.

**Data representations in the mandatory 7–10 syllabuses**

Across the 7–10 curriculum, there are opportunities for students to engage with data. Whole school planning, sequencing and collaboration can support a consistent approach to data. There are a number of mandatory 7–10 syllabuses that explicitly address data in content.

Mandatory 7–10 syllabuses that explicitly address data in the essential content include:

-   Geography 7–10

-   Mathematics 7–10

-   Science 7–10

-   Technology 7–8.

To support a consistent approach to data across the 7–10 curriculum, the most common methods of presenting data displays and statistical measures are listed below.

**\
**

**Data displays**

-   Table

-   Pictogram

-   Column graph (and bar graph)

-   Multiple (or side-by-side) column graph

-   Compound column graph

-   Sector graph

-   Dot map

-   Line graph

-   Scatter plot

-   Box plot

-   Infographic

**Statistical measures**

-   Mean

-   Median

-   Mode

-   Range

-   Standard deviation

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the pictogram.

-   A key should be included to explain the meaning of the symbols used.

-   Partial symbols may be used to show fractional quantities.

-   Symbols used should not be scaled to represent value. The value of the category is shown by the number of symbols used.

### Column graph (and bar graph)

A column graph is used for organising and displaying categorical data. Rectangular columns are constructed for each category, with their height corresponding to the observed frequency or magnitude of the category.

A bar graph uses horizontal rectangular bars for each category. As with a column graph, rectangular bars are used, with their length corresponding to the frequency or magnitude of the category.

![A column graph and a bar graph representing the hair colour of students.](media/image3.png){width="6.268055555555556in" height="2.2444444444444445in"}

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the graph.

-   Both the horizontal and vertical axes should be labelled with titles and units of measurement where appropriate.

-   Columns/bars should be equal width and evenly spaced.

### Compound column graph

A compound column graph displays data for groups of individuals or things categorised according to 2 or more criteria by stacking these data segments on top of each other in each category. This shows the total value for each category, as well as the contribution of each individual dataset to that total.

![A compound column graph representing the hair colour and hair type of students.](media/image5.jpeg){width="2.913043525809274in" height="2.251106736657918in"}

Figure 4: An example of a compound column graph

#### Conventions

-   Meets all the conventions of a column graph.

-   A key should be included to indicate different criteria.

-   Measured variables have different colours or shading.

-   Column height is the total of the measured variables for each category.

### Sector graph

A sector graph is a circular diagram divided into sectors. Each sector represents a specific category or group in a dataset. The size of each sector is proportional to the quantity or percentage of that category, providing a visual representation of the relative proportions.

Figure 5: An example of a sector graph

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the graph.

-   A key should be included to explain the meaning of each sector.

-   Including labels and/or percentages for each sector is optional.

-   The total of all sectors should add up to 360{^\circ} or 100%.

### Dot map

A dot map is a visual tool used to represent the distribution of data points across a geographic area.

Figure 6: An example of a dot map

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the dot map.

-   A key should be included to explain the meaning of the dots.

-   The dots can represent one data point or a given quantity, and the size of the dots can vary to represent quantity.

-   Dots can be multiple colours to represent different categories.

-   The location needs to be specified.

-   Some dot maps will include geographical or other features, such as roads or towns.

### Line graph

A line graph represents the changing relationship between 2 variables. It uses lines to connect individual data points, and is generally used to show how something changes over time.

![A line graph representing the sales of a company over 12 months.](media/image8.jpeg){width="3.2086964129483815in" height="2.550272309711286in"}

Figure 7: An example of a line graph

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the graph.

-   Both the horizontal and vertical axes should be labelled with titles and units of measurement, if appropriate.

-   Data points should be clearly plotted with a dot or cross.

-   A line is drawn between each data point so that all data points are connected.

-   Multiple line graphs representing different datasets can be graphed on the same axis. A key should be included to indicate what each line represents.

A scatter plot is a visual representation of bivariate numerical data that uses the position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axes to indicate the numerical values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.

Figure 8: An example of a scatter plot

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the scatter plot.

-   Both the horizontal and vertical axes should be labelled with titles and units of measurement.

-   Should be of an appropriate scale with consistent divisions.

-   Data points should be clearly plotted with a dot or cross.

-   A straight line can be drawn through the centre of all data points (this is known as the 'line of best fit' or 'trend line').

### Box plot

A box plot is a graphical representation that displays the 5-number summary of a set of data. The 5-number summary consists of a:

-   minimum value

-   lower quartile

-   median

-   upper quartile

-   maximum value.

The 'box' covers the middle 50% of scores between the lower and upper quartiles. The 'whiskers' extend to the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. A vertical line in the box is used to indicate the location of the median.

#### Conventions

-   Title should be clear, concise and accurately reflect the content of the box plot.

-   The axis should be labelled with a title and units of measurement.

-   Multiple box plots representing different datasets can be graphed on the same axis.

## Statistical measures

There are 2 main types of statistical measures.

-   **Measures of centre:** a statistic that is used to summarise the centre of a dataset. The 3 common measures of the centre for a dataset are 'mean', 'median' and 'mode.

-   **Measures of spread:** a statistic that is used to summarise the spread of a dataset. The most used measures of spread are 'range' and 'standard deviation'.

**Outliers** are data values that appear to stand out from the other members of a dataset by being unusually high or low. Outliers can have an impact on some measures of centre and spread. For example, if the ages of all people present in a Year 7 class were collected, the teacher\'s age would be an outlier. This is because it is significantly higher than the ages of the students, who are typically between 11 and 12 years old.

### Measures of centre 

#### Mean

The **mean** (or 'average\') is the sum of values in a dataset, divided by the total number of values in the dataset.

The mean is calculated by adding up all the scores in a dataset and dividing them by the total number of scores. For example:

#### Median

The **median** is the value (or 'middle value') in a set of ordered data that divides the data into 2 parts.

The median is determined by arranging the values from smallest to largest and identifying the middle value.

For an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.

For an even number of values, the median is between the 2 middle values.

### Measures of spread

#### Range

The **range** is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.

It is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value.

$Range = \ highest\ value - lowest\ value$

#### Standard deviation

**Standard deviation** is the measure of the variability, or spread, of a dataset. It provides an indication of the degree to which individual data values are spread around their mean.

Standard deviation measures how spread out the data points are from the mean. Understanding the formula to calculate standard deviation is not necessary in 7–10.

Students can use a scientific calculator or spreadsheet to calculate this measure for a dataset.
