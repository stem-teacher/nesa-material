Introduction

Stage 6 Curriculum
NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) Stage 6 syllabuses have been developed to provide
students with opportunities to further develop skills which will assist in the next stage of their lives.

The purpose of Stage 6 syllabuses is to:
●   develop a solid foundation of literacy and numeracy
●   provide a curriculum structure which encourages students to complete secondary education at
    their highest possible level
●   foster the intellectual, creative, ethical and social development of students, in particular relating to:
    – application of knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes in the fields of study they
         choose
    – capacity to manage their own learning and to become flexible, independent thinkers, problem-
         solvers and decision-makers
    – capacity to work collaboratively with others
    – respect for the cultural diversity of Australian society
    – desire to continue learning in formal or informal settings after school
●   provide a flexible structure within which students can meet the challenges of and prepare for:
    – further academic study, vocational training and employment
    – changing workplaces, including an increasingly STEM-focused (Science, Technology,
         Engineering and Mathematics) workforce
    – full and active participation as global citizens
●   provide formal assessment and certification of students’ achievements
●   promote the development of students’ values, identity and self-respect.

The Stage 6 syllabuses reflect the principles of the NESA K–10 Curriculum Framework and
Statement of Equity Principles, the reforms of the NSW Government Stronger HSC Standards (2016),
and nationally agreed educational goals. These syllabuses build on the continuum of learning
developed in the K–10 syllabuses.

The syllabuses provide a set of broad learning outcomes that summarise the knowledge,
understanding, skills, values and attitudes important for students to succeed in and beyond their
schooling. In particular, the attainment of skills in literacy and numeracy needed for further study,
employment and active participation in society are provided in the syllabuses in alignment with the
Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF).

The Stage 6 syllabuses include the content of the Australian curriculum and additional descriptions
that clarify the scope and depth of learning in each subject.

NESA syllabuses support a standards-referenced approach to assessment by detailing the important
knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes students will develop and outlining clear
standards of what students are expected to know and be able to do. The syllabuses take into account
the diverse needs of all students and provide structures and processes by which teachers can provide
continuity of study for all students.




                                    Physics Stage 6 Syllabus           4
Diversity of Learners
NSW Stage 6 syllabuses are inclusive of the learning needs of all students. Syllabuses accommodate
teaching approaches that support student diversity, including students with special education needs,
gifted and talented students, and students learning English as an additional language or dialect
(EAL/D). Students may have more than one learning need.


Students with Special Education Needs
All students are entitled to participate in and progress through the curriculum. Schools are required to
provide additional support or adjustments to teaching, learning and assessment activities for some
students with special education needs. Adjustments are measures or actions taken in relation to
teaching, learning and assessment that enable a student with special education needs to access
syllabus outcomes and content, and demonstrate achievement of outcomes.

Students with special education needs can access the outcomes and content from Stage 6 syllabuses
in a range of ways. Students may engage with:
●   Stage 6 syllabus outcomes and content with adjustments to teaching, learning and/or assessment
    activities; or
●   selected Stage 6 Life Skills outcomes and content from one or more Stage 6 Life Skills
    syllabuses.

Decisions regarding curriculum options, including adjustments, should be made in the context of
collaborative curriculum planning with the student, parent/carer and other significant individuals to
ensure that decisions are appropriate for the learning needs and priorities of individual students.

Further information can be found in support materials for:
●   Physics
●   Special education needs
●   Life Skills.


Gifted and Talented Students
Gifted students have specific learning needs that may require adjustments to the pace, level and
content of the curriculum. Differentiated educational opportunities assist in meeting the needs of gifted
students.

Generally, gifted students demonstrate the following characteristics:
●   the capacity to learn at faster rates
●   the capacity to find and solve problems
●   the capacity to make connections and manipulate abstract ideas.

There are different kinds and levels of giftedness. Gifted and talented students may also possess
learning difficulties and/or disabilities that should be addressed when planning appropriate teaching,
learning and assessment activities.




                                   Physics Stage 6 Syllabus          5
Curriculum strategies for gifted and talented students may include:
●   differentiation: modifying the pace, level and content of teaching, learning and assessment
    activities
●   acceleration: promoting a student to a level of study beyond their age group
●   curriculum compacting: assessing a student’s current level of learning and addressing aspects of
    the curriculum that have not yet been mastered.

School decisions about appropriate strategies are generally collaborative and involve teachers,
parents and students with reference to documents and advice available from NESA and the education
sectors.

Gifted and talented students may also benefit from individual planning to determine the curriculum
options, as well as teaching, learning and assessment strategies, most suited to their needs and
abilities.


Students Learning English as an Additional Language or Dialect
(EAL/D)
Many students in Australian schools are learning English as an additional language or dialect
(EAL/D). EAL/D students are those whose first language is a language or dialect other than Standard
Australian English and who require additional support to assist them to develop English language
proficiency.

EAL/D students come from diverse backgrounds and may include:
●   overseas and Australian-born students whose first language is a language other than English,
    including creoles and related varieties
●   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students whose first language is Aboriginal English, including
    Kriol and related varieties.

EAL/D students enter Australian schools at different ages and stages of schooling and at different
stages of English language learning. They have diverse talents and capabilities and a range of prior
learning experiences and levels of literacy in their first language and in English. EAL/D students
represent a significant and growing percentage of learners in NSW schools. For some, school is the
only place they use Standard Australian English.

EAL/D students are simultaneously learning a new language and the knowledge, understanding and
skills of the Physics Stage 6 Syllabus through that new language. They may require additional
support, along with informed teaching that explicitly addresses their language needs.

The ESL Scales and the English as an Additional Language or Dialect: Teacher Resource provide
information about the English language development phases of EAL/D students. These materials and
other resources can be used to support the specific needs of English language learners and to assist
students to access syllabus outcomes and content.

Physics Key
The following codes and icons are used in the Physics Stage 6 Syllabus.


Outcome Coding
Syllabus outcomes have been coded in a consistent way. The code identifies the subject, Year and
outcome number. For example:




Outcome code       Interpretation

PH11/12-1          Physics – outcome number 1

PH11-8             Year 11 Physics – outcome number 8

PH12-14            Year 12 Physics – outcome number 14


Working Scientifically outcomes 1–7 are common across Year 11 and Year 12.

Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 11 are numbered 8–11.

Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 12 are numbered 12–15.




                                 Physics Stage 6 Syllabus        7
Coding of Australian Curriculum Content
Australian curriculum content descriptions included in the syllabus are identified by an Australian
curriculum code which appears in brackets at the end of each content description. For example:
    Conduct investigations, including using temperature, current and potential difference measuring
    devices, safely, competently and methodically for the collection of valid and reliable data
    (ACSPH003).




Where a number of content descriptions are jointly represented, all description codes are included, for
example (ACSPH001, ACSPH002, ACSPH003).

Rationale
The Physics Stage 6 Syllabus involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time,
along with related concepts that include energy and force. Physics deals with the study of phenomena
on scales of space and time – from nuclear particles and their interactions up to the size and age of
the Universe. This allows students to better understand the physical world and how it works,
appreciate the uniqueness of the Universe, and participate in navigating and influencing the future.

The problem-solving nature of physics further develops students’ Working Scientifically skills by
focusing on the exploration of models and the analysis of theories and laws, which promotes an
understanding of the connectedness of seemingly dissimilar phenomena.

Students who study physics are encouraged to use observations to develop quantitative models of
real-world problems and derive relationships between variables. They are required to engage in
solving equations based on these models, make predictions, and analyse the interconnectedness of
physical entities.

The Physics course builds on students’ knowledge and skills developed in the Science Stage 5
course and help them develop a greater understanding of physics as a foundation for undertaking
post-school studies in a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
fields. A knowledge and understanding of physics often provides the unifying link between
interdisciplinary studies.

The study of physics provides the foundation knowledge and skills required to support participation in
a range of careers. It is a discipline that utilises innovative and creative thinking to address new
challenges, such as sustainability, energy efficiency and the creation of new materials.

Working Scientifically
Working Scientifically skills are at the core of conducting practical and secondary-sourced
investigations in science.

Opportunities should be provided for students to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills in
investigations. In each module, particular outcomes have been identified as those that are most
relevant to the intended learning.

Students are challenged to further develop their understanding of Working Scientifically as a group of
dynamic and interdependent processes that are applied in each scientific investigation in a way that is
appropriate and determined by the activity. This dynamism and interrelatedness adds a level of
sophistication to students’ understanding of the true nature and practice of science. Through regular
involvement in these processes, applying them as appropriate, in a range of varied practical
investigations; students can broaden their interpretation of Working Scientifically beyond the common
linear model.

Students are encouraged to select the most appropriate gateway to the Working Scientifically
processes. The pathways within the processes become self-evident through the nature of the
investigation. An investigation may be instigated by, for example:
●   direct observation of a phenomenon
●   inconsistencies arising from results of a related investigation
●   the quantitative and qualitative analysis of data
●   secondary-sourced research.

Students are challenged to be open to:
●   refining or redeveloping their chosen procedures
●   redefining their questions and/or hypotheses
●   modifying their methodologies or designs
●   conducting further practical investigations
●   conducting further secondary research.

Students are also encouraged to communicate evidence-based conclusions and suggest ideas for
future research. Unexpected results are to be welcomed to refine methodologies and to generate
further investigation. Knowledge and understanding of science is essential to these processes.
Through this practice of science, students can acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of
scientific concepts.

Each of the seven Working Scientifically outcomes represents one of the interdependent dynamic
processes that are central to the study of Science and the acquisition of scientific knowledge and
skills. This course is structured to provide ongoing opportunities for students to implement these
processes, particularly through the depth study provision. The following descriptions of the Working
Scientifically outcomes provide further information about the skills students are expected to develop
throughout the course.


Questioning and Predicting
Developing, proposing and evaluating inquiry questions and hypotheses challenges students to
identify an issue or phenomenon that can be investigated scientifically by gathering primary and/or
secondary-sourced data. Students develop inquiry question(s) that require observations,
experimentation and/or research to aid in constructing a reasonable and informed hypothesis. The
consideration of variables is to be included in the questioning process.




                                  Physics Stage 6 Syllabus         22
Planning Investigations
Students justify the selection of equipment, resources chosen and design of an investigation. They
ensure that all risks are assessed, appropriate materials and technologies are sourced, and all ethical
concerns are considered. Variables are to be identified as independent, dependent and controlled to
ensure a valid procedure is developed that will allow for the reliable collection of data. Investigations
should include strategies that ensure controlled variables are kept constant and an experimental
control is used as appropriate.


Conducting Investigations
Students are to select appropriate equipment, employ safe work practices and ensure that risk
assessments are conducted and followed. Appropriate technologies are to be used and procedures
followed when disposing of waste. The selection and criteria for collecting valid and reliable data is to
be methodical and, where appropriate, secondary-sourced information referenced correctly.


Processing Data and Information
Students use the most appropriate and meaningful methods and media to organise and analyse data
and information sources, including digital technologies and the use of a variety of visual
representations as appropriate. They process data from primary and secondary sources, including
both qualitative and quantitative data and information.


Analysing Data and Information
Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in
data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and
reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations. They evaluate
processes, claims and conclusions by considering the quality of available evidence, and use
reasoning to construct scientific arguments. Where appropriate, mathematical models are to be
applied, to demonstrate the trends and relationships that occur in data.


Problem Solving
Students use critical thinking skills and creativity to demonstrate an understanding of scientific
principles underlying the solutions to inquiry questions and problems posed in investigations.
Appropriate and varied strategies are employed, including the use of models, to qualitatively and
quantitatively explain and predict cause-and-effect relationships. In Working Scientifically, students
synthesise and use evidence to construct and justify conclusions. To solve problems, students:
interpret scientific and media texts; evaluate processes, claims and conclusions; and consider the
quality of available evidence.


Communicating
Communicating all components of the Working Scientifically processes with clarity and accuracy is
essential. Students use qualitative and quantitative information gained from investigations using
primary and secondary sources, including digital, visual, written and/or verbal forms of communication
as appropriate. They apply appropriate scientific notations and nomenclature. They also appropriately
apply and use scientific language that is suitable for specific audiences and contexts.




                                  Physics Stage 6 Syllabus          23
Investigations
An investigation is a scientific process to answer a question, explore an idea or solve a problem.
Investigations include activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, processing and
analysing data, reaching a conclusion and communicating. Investigations may include the collection
of primary and/or secondary-sourced data or information.

Practical investigations involve the collection of primary data. They may include:
●   undertaking laboratory investigations, including fair tests and controlled experiments
●   undertaking fieldwork and surveys
●   constructing models.

Secondary-sourced investigations can include:
●   researching by using a variety of media
●   extracting and reorganising secondary-sourced information in the form of flow charts, tables,
    graphs, diagrams, prose, keys, spreadsheets and databases
●   using models to inform understanding.


Safety
Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers will need to ensure that they comply
with relevant legislation as well as system and school requirements in relation to safety when
implementing their programs. This includes legislation and guidelines relating to Work Health and
Safety, and the handling and storage of chemical and dangerous goods.


Animal Research
Schools have a legal responsibility in relation to the welfare of animals. The keeping of animals and
all practical activities involving animals must comply with relevant guidelines or legislation.


Inquiry Questions
Inquiry questions are included in the course content and used to frame the syllabus content within
each module. The depth of knowledge and understanding and skill development required to fully
address the inquiry questions may vary. This allows for differentiation of the course content to cater
for the diversity of learners.

                                  Physics Stage 6 Syllabus          28
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have diverse cultures, social structures and a
history of unique, complex knowledge systems. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to
learn about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have developed and refined knowledge
about the world through observation, making predictions, testing (trial and error) and responding to
environmental factors within specific contexts. Students investigate examples of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Peoples’ understanding of the environment and the ways in which traditional
knowledge and Western scientific knowledge can be complementary.

When planning and programming content relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories
and cultures teachers are encouraged to:
●   involve local Aboriginal communities and/or appropriate knowledge holders in determining
    suitable resources, or to use Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander authored or endorsed
    publications
●   read the Principles and Protocols relating to teaching and learning about Aboriginal and Torres
    Strait Islander histories and cultures and the involvement of local Aboriginal communities.


Asia and Australia’s Engagement with Asia
Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia provides rich and engaging contexts for developing
students’ scientific and technological knowledge, understanding and skills. In Physics students are
provided with opportunities to recognise that the Asia region includes diverse environments. They are
provided with opportunities to appreciate how interactions within and between these environments
and the impacts of human activity influence the region, including Australia, and have significance for
the rest of the world.

Asia plays an important role in scientific and technological research and development in areas such
as medicine, natural resource management and natural disaster prediction and management.


Sustainability
Sustainability is concerned with the ongoing capacity of the Earth to maintain all life. It provides
authentic contexts for exploring, investigating and understanding systems in the natural and human-
made environments. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to investigate relationships
between systems and system components, and consider the sustainability of food sources and the
natural and human environments. Students engage in ethical debate and with different perspectives
in solving ethical problems.


Critical and Creative Thinking
Critical and creative thinking are integral to activities where students learn to generate and evaluate
knowledge, clarify concepts and ideas, seek possibilities, consider alternatives and solve problems.
Critical and creative thinking are embedded in the skills and processes of Working Scientifically. In
order to make evidence-based decisions, students are provided with opportunities to develop critical
and creative thinking skills through: asking and posing questions; making predictions; engaging in
practical and secondary-sourced investigations; and analysing and evaluating evidence.




                                  Physics Stage 6 Syllabus          29
Ethical Understanding
Students are provided with opportunities to develop the capability to assess ethical values and
principles, and to understand how reasoning can assist ethical judgement. In Physics students are
provided with opportunities to form and make ethical judgements in relation to scientific investigations,
design, codes of practice, and the use of scientific information and applications. Students explore the
importance of reporting honestly based on evidence. They apply ethical guidelines in their
investigations, particularly in regard to the implications for others and the environment.


Information and Communication Technology Capability
Information and communication technology (ICT) can be used effectively and appropriately to access,
create and communicate information and ideas, solve problems and work collaboratively. In Physics
students are provided with opportunities to develop ICT capability when they: develop alternative
ideas and solutions; research science concepts and applications; investigate scientific phenomena;
and communicate their scientific and technological understandings. In particular, they have
opportunities to learn to: access information; collect, analyse and represent data; model and interpret
concepts and relationships; and communicate scientific and technological ideas, processes and
information.


Intercultural Understanding
Students develop intercultural understanding as they learn to understand themselves in relation to
others. This involves students valuing their own cultures and those of others, and engaging with
people of diverse cultures in ways that recognise commonalities and differences, create connections
and cultivate respect. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to appreciate how diverse
cultural perspectives have impacted on the development, breadth and diversity of scientific knowledge
and applications. They learn about and engage with issues requiring cultural sensitivity, and learn that
scientists work in culturally diverse teams to address issues and solve problems of national and
international importance.


Literacy
Literacy is the ability to use a repertoire of knowledge and skills to communicate and comprehend
effectively, using a variety of modes and media. Being ‘literate’ is more than the acquisition of
technical skills – it includes the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create and communicate
effectively using written, visual and digital forms of expression and communication for a number of
purposes. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to understand that language varies
according to the context and engage with different forms of written and spoken language to
communicate scientific concepts. They learn that scientific information can also be presented in the
form of diagrams, flow charts, tables, graphs and models.


Numeracy
Numeracy involves recognising and understanding the role of mathematics in the world. Students
become numerate as they develop the confidence, willingness and ability to apply mathematics in
their lives in constructive and meaningful ways. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to
develop numeracy skills through practical measurement and the collection, representation and
interpretation of data from first-hand investigations and secondary sources. Students consider issues
of uncertainty and reliability in measurement and have opportunities to learn data analysis skills,
identifying trends and patterns from numerical data and graphs. They apply mathematical
relationships and concepts in order to solve problems.



                                  Physics Stage 6 Syllabus          30
Personal and Social Capability
Students develop personal and social capability as they learn to understand and manage themselves,
their relationships and their lives more effectively. This includes establishing positive relationships,
making responsible decisions, working effectively individually and in teams, and constructively
handling challenging situations. Through applying the processes of Working Scientifically, students
can develop skills in collaboration, peer assessment and review. They plan and conduct a depth study
either individually or in a team.


Civics and Citizenship
Civics and citizenship content involves knowledge and understanding of how our Australian society
operates. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to broaden their understanding of
aspects of civics and citizenship related to the application of scientific ideas and technological
advances, including ecological sustainability and the development of environmental and sustainable
practices at a local, regional and national level.


Difference and Diversity
Difference and diversity comprise gender, race and socio-economic circumstances. Students are
provided with opportunities to understand and appreciate the difference and diversity they experience
in their everyday lives. Working Scientifically provides opportunities for students to work
collaboratively, where they can develop an appreciation of the values and ideas of all group members.
This appreciation also enables students to identify individual rights, challenge stereotypes and
engage with opinions that are different to their own.


Work and Enterprise
Students can develop work-related skills and an appreciation of the value of working individually and
collaboratively when conducting investigations. In Physics students are provided with opportunities to
prioritise safe practices and understand the potential risks and hazards present when conducting
investigations. They engage with risk assessment while working safely in the laboratory or the field.

Content Focus
Motion is a fundamental observable phenomenon. The study of kinematics involves describing,
measuring and analysing motion without considering the forces and masses involved in that motion.
Uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and
vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration and time.

Representations – including graphs and vectors, and equations of motion – can be used qualitatively
and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion.

By studying this module, students come to understand that scientific knowledge enables scientists to
offer valid explanations and make reliable predictions, particularly in regard to the motion of an object.


Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on designing, evaluating and conducting investigations to examine
trends in data and solve problems related to kinematics. Students should be provided with
opportunities to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.


Content

Motion in a Straight Line
Inquiry question: How is the motion of an object moving in a straight line described and predicted?

Students:
●   describe uniform straight-line (rectilinear) motion and uniformly accelerated motion through:
    – qualitative descriptions
    – the use of scalar and vector quantities (ACSPH060)
●   conduct a practical investigation to gather data to facilitate the analysis of instantaneous and
    average velocity through:
    – quantitative, first-hand measurements
    – the graphical representation and interpretation of data (ACSPH061)

Module 2: Dynamics

Outcomes
A student:
›   designs and evaluates investigations in order to obtain primary and secondary data and
    information PH11/12-2
›   selects and processes appropriate qualitative and quantitative data and information using a range
    of appropriate media PH11/12-4
›   solves scientific problems using primary and secondary data, critical thinking skills and scientific
    processes PH11/12-6
›   describes and explains events in terms of Newton’s Laws of Motion, the law of conservation of
    momentum and the law of conservation of energy PH11-9


Content Focus
The relationship between the motion of objects and the forces that act on them is often complex.
However, Newton’s Laws of Motion can be used to describe the effect of forces on the motion of
single objects and simple systems. This module develops the key concept that forces are always
produced in pairs that act on different objects and add to zero.

By applying Newton’s laws directly to simple systems, and, where appropriate, the law of
conservation of momentum and law of conservation of mechanical energy, students examine the
effects of forces. They also examine the interactions and relationships that can occur between objects
by modelling and representing these using vectors and equations.

In many situations, within and beyond the discipline of physics, knowing the rates of change of
quantities provides deeper insight into various phenomena. In this module, the rates of change of
displacement, velocity and energy are of particular significance and students develop an
understanding of the usefulness and limitations of modelling.


Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on designing, evaluating and conducting investigations and interpreting
trends in data to solve problems related to dynamics. Students should be provided with opportunities
to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.

Content Focus
Wave motion involves the transfer of energy without the transfer of matter. By exploring the behaviour
of wave motion and examining the characteristics of wavelength, frequency, period, velocity and
amplitude, students further their understanding of the properties of waves. They are then able to
demonstrate how waves can be reflected, refracted, diffracted and superposed (interfered) and to
develop an understanding that not all waves require a medium for their propagation. Students
examine mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves, including their similarities and differences.

Students also examine energy and its transfer, in the form of heat, from one place to another.
Thermodynamics is the study of the relationship between energy, work, temperature and matter.
Understanding this relationship allows students to appreciate particle motion within objects. Students
have the opportunity to examine how hot objects lose energy in three ways: first, by conduction, and,
second, by convection – which both involve the motion of particles; and, third, the emission of
electromagnetic radiation. An understanding of thermodynamics is a pathway to understanding
related concepts in many fields involving Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM).

Content Focus
Motion in one dimension at constant velocity or constant acceleration can be explained and analysed
relatively simply. However, motion is frequently more complicated because objects move in two or
three dimensions, causing the net force to vary in size or direction.

Students develop an understanding that all forms of complex motion can be understood by analysing
the forces acting on a system, including the energy transformations taking place within and around
the system. By applying new mathematical techniques, students model and predict the motion of
objects within systems. They examine two-dimensional motion, including projectile motion and
uniform circular motion, along with the orbital motion of planets and satellites, which are modelled as
an approximation to uniform circular motion.


Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on gathering, analysing and evaluating data to solve problems and
communicate ideas about advanced mechanics. Students should be provided with opportunities to
engage with all the Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.

Content Focus
Discoveries about the interactions that take place between charged particles and electric and
magnetic fields not only produced significant advances in physics, but also led to significant
technological developments. These developments include the generation and distribution of
electricity, and the invention of numerous devices that convert electrical energy into other forms of
energy.

Understanding the similarities and differences in the interactions of single charges in electric and
magnetic fields provides students with a conceptual foundation for this module. Phenomena that
include the force produced on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field, the force between current-
carrying wires, Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, the principles of transformers and the
workings of motors and generators can all be understood as instances of forces acting on moving
charged particles in magnetic fields.

The law of conservation of energy underpins all of these interactions. The conversion of energy into
forms other than the intended form is a problem that constantly drives engineers to improve designs
of electromagnetic devices.

Content Focus
Prior to the 20th century, physicists, including Newton and Maxwell, developed theories and models
about mechanics, electricity and magnetism and the nature of matter. These theories and models had
great explanatory power and produced useful predictions. However, the 20th century saw major
developments in physics as existing theories and models were challenged by new observations that
could not be explained. These observations led to the development of quantum theory and the theory
of relativity. Technologies arising from these theories have shaped the modern world. For example,
the independence of the speed of light on the frame of observation or the motion of the source and
observer had significant consequences for the measurement, and concepts about the nature, of time
and space.

Throughout this module, students explore the evidence supporting these physical theories, along with
the power of scientific theories to make useful predictions.


Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on developing and evaluating questions and hypotheses when
designing and conducting investigations; evaluating the data obtained from investigations; and

Module 8: From the Universe to the Atom

Outcomes
A student:
›   analyses and evaluates primary and secondary data and information PH11/12-5
›   solves scientific problems using primary and secondary data, critical thinking skills and scientific
    processes PH11/12-6
›   communicates scientific understanding using suitable language and terminology for a specific
    audience or purpose PH11/12-7
›   explains and analyses the evidence supporting the relationship between astronomical events and
    the nucleosynthesis of atoms and relates these to the development of the current model of the
    atom PH12-15


Content Focus
Humans have always been fascinated with the finite or infinite state of the Universe and whether there
ever was a beginning to time. Where does all the matter that makes up the Universe come from?
Ideas and theories about the beginnings of the Universe, based on sound scientific evidence, have
come and gone. Current theories such as the Big Bang theory and claims of an expanding Universe
are based on scientific evidence available today through investigations that use modern technologies.
Evidence gathered on the nucleosynthesis reactions in stars allows scientists to understand how
elements are made in the nuclear furnace of stars. On scales as large as the Universe to those as
small as an atom, humans look to the sky for answers through astronomical observations of stars and
galaxies.

Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, experimental discoveries revolutionised the
accepted understanding of the nature of matter on an atomic scale. Observations of the properties of
matter and light inspired the development of better models of matter, which in turn have been
modified or abandoned in the light of further experimental investigations.

By studying the development of the atomic models through the work of Thomson and Rutherford, who
established the nuclear model of the atom – a positive nucleus surrounded by electrons – students
further their understanding of the limitations of theories and models. The work of Bohr, de Broglie and,
later, Schrödinger demonstrated that the quantum mechanical nature of matter was a better way to
understand the structure of the atom. Experimental investigations of the nucleus have led to an
understanding of radioactive decay, the ability to extract energy from nuclear fission and fusion, and a
deeper understanding of the atomic model.

Particle accelerators have revealed that protons themselves are not fundamental, and have continued
to provide evidence in support of the Standard Model of matter. In studying this module, students can
appreciate that the fundamental particle model is forever being updated and that our understanding of
the nature of matter remains incomplete.
