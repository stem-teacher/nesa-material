# Science 7–10 (2023): Sample unit (Stage 5) – Energy

Sample units are provided by NESA to illustrate teaching, learning and assessment of syllabus outcomes and content. Teachers should refer to [Curriculum registration and accreditation requirements and programming and record keeping advice](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/b690c31f-cdb3-4da8-8f28-253ad5f98fe6/fact-sheet-curriculum-september-2023.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=) for further information.

**Unit title:** What is energy? [See – Sample scope and sequence: Sample scope and sequence: Stage 5](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023/teaching-and-learning)

**Duration:** 10 weeks

**Description:** Students explore the different types of energy and how it can be stored, transferred and used to run everyday devices. They develop skills in observing and conducting investigations using electrical circuits to compare voltage, current and resistance in order to prove Ohm\'s law. Students learn how electrical energy flows through different types of circuits. They learn how to evaluate data so that they can make better energy choices in future.

**Working scientifically processes:**

-   Observing

-   Conducting investigations

-   Problem-solving.

Some resources and activities in this unit may need to be adjusted for students with vision impairment. This could include the use of 3D models and tactile graphics to interpret and represent data.

One joule is the energy needed (i.e. work done) in moving a force of one newton over a distance of one metre in the direction of the force. For energy to be conserved, the energy input to a system equals the output energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The teacher provides examples of closed systems and explains that although energy is conserved in closed systems, input energy may be transformed into less useful forms (for example, heat energy is not the desired energy for a light globe).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For example, a hand-powered generator, solar circuit, wind turbine, hydroelectric circuit or solid fuel steam engine.

Students graph average voltage against average current and observe that the steepness of the line of best fit correlates with the magnitude of the resistance. Students are guided to develop a mathematical representation of this relationship (i.e. Ohm's Law).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Students use data loggers, light sensors, stopwatches and thermometers to take appropriate measurements.

Students use the specific heat capacity of water (c = 4.18Jg^{- 1}{{^\circ}C}^{- 1}) to determine output energy q = mc\mathrm{\Delta}T$ and the electrical power equation to find input energy. Students can compare the time taken for different heating effects and share their results using a written report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Students explore existing or emerging alternative energy sources in different global areas by reading academic papers and accessing news stories from reputable sources. Students use the information and datasets to identify trends and patterns in energy use, then predict possible solutions to reducing consumption. The teacher may focus students' investigations on a particular area of global energy demand to reduce cognitive load and support student learning. This may involve providing shorter extracts from academic papers and news stories to streamline the process of gathering evidence for students. |
