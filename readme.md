# NESA Material

The following directories contain:
1. Copies of the NESA source curriculum material.
2. Program's to convert word and PDF documents to markdown format. This is to support processing by AI Agents and other activities.
3. Programs to prepare trace outcomes.
4. Manually converted documnets where automation was not performed.


An action has established to support the conversion process, however the program convert-2.js may be run manually thus
```javascript
node convert-2.js
```

The program assumes pandoc & poppler i.e.:
```
brew install  pandoc
brew install poppler
```

Again - this is defined with the conversion action.
