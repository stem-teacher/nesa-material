*Image long description:* This is a diagram outlining the organisation
content for the Software Engineering 11--12 Syllabus. Content is listed
in boxes,Â Programming fundamentals, The object-oriented paradigm, and
Programming mechatronics fall under Year 11 on the left. Secure software
architecture, Programming for the web, Software automation and Software
Engineering project fall under Year 12 on the right. In the middle is
Learning through project work, with lines coming from this box and
encircling the content. Surrounding all content of the diagram is a line
which is joined at the bottom by a box labelled, Skills. This
demonstrates that Skills is being both developed and used in all focus
areas.

#### Software Engineering course specifications

The Software Engineering Course Specifications are an integral part of
the course content for Year 11 and Year 12 and indicate the depth of
study required for some concepts in the *Software Engineering 11*--*12
Syllabus*. The *Software Engineering 11*--*12 Syllabus* must be applied
in conjunction with the [[Software Engineering Course
Specifications]{.underline}](https://library.curriculum.nsw.edu.au/341419dc-8ec2-0289-7225-6db7f2d751ef/94e1eb0a-0df7-4dbe-9b72-5d5e0d17143a/software-engineering-11-12-higher-school-certificate-course-specifications.PDF).

##  Rationale

The study of *Software Engineering 11--12* enables students to develop
an understanding of software engineering as a facet of computer science.
Students have the opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of
software engineering, hardware and software integration, and the
development, implementation and evaluation of computer programs. They
focus on a systematic approach to problem-solving when designing and
developing creative software solutions.

Software Engineering promotes a deeper understanding of fundamental
concepts, programming languages and innovative technologies, leading to
greater flexibility when developing software solutions. Students perform
project work and apply their knowledge and skills in: programming
fundamentals, the object-oriented paradigm, programming mechatronics,
secure software architecture, programming for the web and software
automation, and use the acquired knowledge and skills to develop a
software engineering project. Project work enables students to
collaborate on problems and develop team and communication skills that
are highly valued in the industry.

Software Engineering encourages students to explore the impact of
innovations in computing technology on society and the environment. They
engage with technologies that improve access to, and participation in, a
range of industries.

The *Software Engineering 11--12* *Syllabus* provides students with the
opportunity to develop their computing skills across 4 domains:
technical skills, social awareness, project management and thinking
skills. Students are encouraged to transfer knowledge to new situations
and projects, building on technical skills and past learning. They
enhance their understanding of project management through collaboration,
communicating ideas, engaging in processes and designing solutions.

##  Aim

The aim of Software Engineering is to develop in each student:

-   a capacity to think creatively to develop and program software
    solutions

-   an ability to apply knowledge, understanding and thinking skills to
    develop and communicate solutions to real-world problems.
