# Investigating Science Key

The following codes and icons are used in the *Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus*.

## Outcome Coding

Syllabus outcomes have been coded in a consistent way. The code identifies the subject, Year and outcome number. For example:

![Outcome coding diagram showing outcome code INS12-12 where \'INS\' is Investigating Science, \'11\' is Year 11 and \'8\' is Outcome 8](img/media/image2.png "Outcome coding diagram")

| **Outcome code** | **Interpretation**                                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INS11/12-1       | Investigating Science -- outcome number 1                         |
| INS11-8          | Year 11 Investigating Science -- outcome number 8                 |
| INS12-12         | Year 12 Investigating Science -- outcome number 12                |

Working Scientifically outcomes 1--7 are common across Year 11 and Year 12. Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 11 are numbered 8--11. Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 12 are numbered 12--15.

# Rationale

The *Investigating Science Stage 6* *Syllabus* is designed to assist students of all abilities engage with scientific processes, and apply those processes to investigate relevant personal, community and global scientific issues.

The ongoing study of science and the specific Working Scientifically skills processes and their application have led humans to accumulate an evidence-based body of knowledge about human interactions -- past, present and future -- with the world and its galactic neighbourhood. The course is firmly focused on developing the Working Scientifically skills, as they provide a foundation for students to value investigation, solve problems, develop and communicate evidence-based arguments, and make informed decisions.

The course promotes active inquiry and explores key concepts, models and phenomena. It draws and builds on the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes gained in Science Stage 5. The Stage 6 course is designed to enhance students' understanding of the value of evidence-based investigations and the use of science-based inquiry in their lives.

The Investigating Science course is designed to complement the study of the science disciplines by providing additional opportunities for students to investigate and develop an understanding of scientific concepts, their current and future uses, and their impacts on science and society. The course draws on and promotes interdisciplinary science, by allowing students to investigate a wide range of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related issues and concepts in depth.

Investigating Science encourages the development of a range of capabilities and capacities that enhance a student's ability to participate in all aspects of community life and within a fast-changing technological landscape. The knowledge, understanding and skills gained from this course are intended to support students' ongoing engagement with science, and to form the foundation for further studies and participation in current and emerging STEM-related post-school activities and industries.

# Assessment and Reporting

Information about assessment in relation to the Investigating Science syllabus is contained in *Assessment and Reporting in Investigating Science Stage 6*. It outlines course-specific advice and requirements regarding:

- Year 11 and Year 12 school-based assessment requirements

- Year 11 and Year 12 mandatory components and weightings

- External assessment requirements including HSC examination specifications.

This information should be read in conjunction with requirements on the [Assessment Certification Examination (ACE)](http://ace.bostes.nsw.edu.au/) website.

Additional advice is available in the *Principles of Assessment for Stage 6*.

# Content

Content defines what students are expected to know and do as they work towards syllabus outcomes. It provides the foundations for students to successfully progress to the next stage of schooling or post-school opportunities.

Teachers will make decisions about content regarding the sequence, emphasis and any adjustments required based on the needs, interests, abilities and prior learning of students.

Content in Stage 6 syllabuses defines learning expectations that may be assessed in Higher School Certificate examinations.

## Organisation of Content

The following diagram provides an illustrative representation of elements of the course and their relationship.

The Year 11 and Year 12 courses each comprise four modules. The skills of Working Scientifically are integrated as course content throughout the syllabus. Each module includes a specific focus on some of the Working Scientifically skills. However, there is scope within each module to engage with all of the Working Scientifically skills.

![The organisation of content diagram consists of a central circle showing the Working Scientifically skills: Questioning and Predicting, Planning Investigations, Conducting Investigations, Processing Data and Information, Analysing Data and Information, Problem Solving, and Communicating. The central circle is surrounded by a ring divided in into the Year 11 and Year 12 modules. The Year 11 modules are: Module 1 Cause and Effect -- Observing, Module 2 Cause and Effect -- Inferences and Generalisations, Module 3 Scientific Models and Module 4 Theories and Laws. The Year 12 modules are: Module 5 Scientific Investigations, Module 6 Technologies, Module 7 Fact or Fallacy? and Module 8 Science and Society.](img/media/image17.png "Organisation of content diagram")

The Working Scientifically outcomes and content are integrated into each module wherever students undertake an investigation.

## Working Scientifically

Working Scientifically skills are at the core of conducting practical and secondary-sourced investigations in science.

Opportunities should be provided for students to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills in investigations. In each module, particular outcomes have been identified as those that are most relevant to the intended learning.

Students are challenged to further develop their understanding of Working Scientifically as a group of dynamic and interdependent processes that are applied in each scientific investigation in a way that is appropriate and determined by the activity. This dynamism and interrelatedness adds a level of sophistication to students' understanding of the true nature and practice of science. Through regular involvement in these processes, applying them as appropriate, in a range of varied practical investigations, students can broaden their interpretation of Working Scientifically beyond the common linear model.

Students are encouraged to select the most appropriate gateway to the Working Scientifically processes. The pathways within the processes become self-evident through the nature of the investigation. An investigation may be instigated by, for example:

- direct observation of a phenomenon

- inconsistencies arising from results of a related investigation

- the quantitative and qualitative analysis of data

- secondary-sourced research.

Students are challenged to be open to:

- refining or redeveloping their chosen procedures

- redefining their questions and/or hypotheses

- modifying their methodologies or designs

- conducting further practical investigations

- conducting further secondary research.

Students are also encouraged to communicate evidence-based conclusions and suggest ideas for future research. Unexpected results are to be welcomed to refine methodologies and to generate further investigation. Knowledge and understanding of science is essential to these processes. Through this practice of science, students can acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts.

![The Working Scientifically diagram shows a central circle labelled Working Scientifically. Surrounding the central circle is a ring of circles interconnected with double-ended arrows. Each circle represents the seven Working Scientifically outcomes: Questioning and Predicting, Planning Investigations, Conducting Investigations, Processing Data and Information, Analysing Data and Information, Problem Solving and Communicating. Wrapping around the main diagram is a double-ended arrow pointing to a circle labelled Knowledge and Understanding.](img/media/image18.png "Working Scientifically diagram")

Each of the seven Working Scientifically outcomes represents one of the interdependent dynamic processes that are central to the study of science and the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills. This course is structured to provide ongoing opportunities for students to implement these processes, particularly through the depth study provision. The following descriptions of the Working Scientifically outcomes provide further information about the skills students are expected to develop throughout the course.

### Questioning and Predicting

Developing, proposing and evaluating inquiry questions and hypotheses challenge students to identify an issue or phenomenon that can be investigated scientifically by gathering primary and/or secondary-sourced data. Students develop inquiry question(s) that require observations, experimentation and/or research to aid in constructing a reasonable and informed hypothesis. The consideration of variables is to be included in the questioning process.

### Planning Investigations

Students justify the selection of equipment, resources chosen and design of an investigation. They ensure that all risks are assessed, appropriate materials and technologies are sourced, and all ethical concerns are considered. Variables are to be identified as independent, dependent and controlled to ensure a valid procedure is developed that will allow for the reliable collection of data. Investigations should include strategies that ensure controlled variables are kept constant and an experimental control is used as appropriate.

### Conducting Investigations

Students are to select appropriate equipment, employ safe work practices and ensure that risk assessments are conducted and followed. Appropriate technologies are to be used and procedures followed when disposing of waste. The selection and criteria for collecting valid and reliable data is to be methodical and, where appropriate, secondary-sourced information referenced correctly.

### Processing Data and Information

Students use the most appropriate and meaningful methods and media to organise and analyse data and information sources, including digital technologies and the use of a variety of visual representations as appropriate. They process data from primary and secondary sources, including both qualitative and quantitative data and information.

### Analysing Data and Information

Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations. They evaluate processes, claims and conclusions by considering the quality of available evidence, and use reasoning to construct scientific arguments. Where appropriate, mathematical models are to be applied, to demonstrate the trends and relationships that occur in data.

### Problem Solving

Students use critical thinking skills and creativity to demonstrate an understanding of scientific principles underlying the solutions to inquiry questions and problems posed in investigations. Appropriate and varied strategies are employed, including the use of models to qualitatively and quantitatively explain and predict cause-and-effect relationships. In Working Scientifically, students synthesise and use evidence to construct and justify conclusions. To solve problems, students: interpret scientific and media texts; evaluate processes, claims and conclusions; and consider the quality of available evidence.

### Communicating

Communicating all components of the Working Scientifically processes with clarity and accuracy is essential. Students use qualitative and quantitative information gained from investigations using primary and secondary sources, including digital, visual, written and/or verbal forms of communication as appropriate. They apply appropriate scientific notations and nomenclature. They also appropriately apply and use scientific language that is suitable for specific audiences and contexts.

## Investigations

An investigation is a scientific process to answer a question, explore an idea or solve a problem. Investigations include activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, processing and analysing data, reaching a conclusion and communicating. Investigations may include the collection of primary and/or secondary-sourced data or information.

Practical investigations involve the collection of primary data. They may include:

- undertaking laboratory investigations, including fair tests and controlled experiments

- undertaking fieldwork and surveys

- constructing models.

Secondary-sourced investigations can include:

- researching by using a variety of media

- extracting and reorganising secondary-sourced information in the form of flow charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, prose, keys, spreadsheets and databases

- using models to inform understanding.

### Safety

Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers will need to ensure that they comply with relevant legislation as well as system and school requirements in relation to safety when implementing their programs. This includes legislation and guidelines relating to Work Health and Safety, and the handling and storage of chemical and dangerous goods.

### Animal Research

Schools have a legal responsibility in relation to the welfare of animals. The keeping of animals and all practical activities involving animals must comply with relevant guidelines or legislation.

## Inquiry Questions

Inquiry questions are included in the course content and used to frame the syllabus content within each module. The depth of knowledge and understanding and skill development required to fully address the inquiry questions may vary. This allows for differentiation of the course content to cater for the diversity of learners.

## Depth Studies: Year 11 and Year 12

### What are Depth Studies?

A depth study is any type of investigation/activity that a student completes individually or collaboratively that allows the further development of one or more concepts found within or inspired by the syllabus. It may be one investigation/activity or a series of investigations/activities.

Depth studies provide opportunities for students to pursue their interests in science, acquire a depth of understanding, and take responsibility for their own learning. Depth studies promote differentiation and engagement, and support all forms of assessment, including assessment for, as and of learning. Depth studies allow for the demonstration of a range of Working Scientifically skills.

A depth study may be, but is not limited to:

- a practical investigation or series of practical investigations and/or a secondary-sourced investigation or series of secondary-sourced investigations

- presentations, research assignments or fieldwork reports

- the extension of concepts found within the course, either qualitatively and/or quantitatively.

The length of time for any individual study and the pedagogies employed are not prescribed. The time for the depth studies may be allocated to a single study or spread over the year, and incorporate several studies depending on individual school and/or class requirements.

### Requirements for Depth Studies

- A minimum of 30 hours of in-class time is allocated in both Year 11 and Year 12.

- At least one depth study must be included in both Year 11 and Year 12.

- The two Working Scientifically outcomes of Questioning and Predicting, and Communicating must be addressed in both Year 11 and Year 12.

- A minimum of two additional Working Scientifically skills outcomes, and further development of at least one Knowledge and Understanding outcome, are to be addressed in all depth studies.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have diverse cultures, social structures and a history of unique, complex knowledge systems. In Investigating Science students are provided with opportunities to learn about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have developed and refined knowledge about the world through observation, making predictions, testing (trial and error) and responding to environmental factors within specific contexts. Students investigate examples of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' understanding of the environment and the ways in which traditional knowledge and Western scientific knowledge can be complementary.

When planning and programming content relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures teachers are encouraged to:

- involve local Aboriginal communities and/or appropriate knowledge holders in determining suitable resources, or to use Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander authored or endorsed publications

- read the [*Principles and Protocols*](https://ab-ed.nesa.nsw.edu.au/principles-and-protocols) relating to teaching and learning about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures and the involvement of local Aboriginal communities.

### Asia and Australia's Engagement with Asia ![Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia icon](img/media/image22.png "Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia icon")

Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia provides rich and engaging contexts for developing students' science and technology knowledge, understanding and skills. In Investigating Science students are provided with opportunities to recognise that the Asia region includes diverse environments. They are provided with opportunities to appreciate how interactions within and between these environments and the impacts of human activity influence the region, including Australia, and have significance for the rest of the world.

Asia plays an important role in scientific and technological research and development in areas such as medicine, natural resource management and natural disaster prediction and management.

### Sustainability ![Sustainability icon](img/media/image23.png "Sustainability icon")

Sustainability is concerned with the ongoing capacity of the Earth to maintain all life. It provides authentic contexts for exploring, investigating and understanding systems in the natural and human-made environments. In Investigating Science students are provided with opportunities to investigate relationships between systems and system components, and consider the sustainability of food sources and the natural and human environments. Students engage in ethical debate and with different perspectives in solving ethical problems.

### Critical and Creative Thinking ![Critical and creative thinking icon](img/media/image24.png "Critical and creative thinking icon")

Critical and creative thinking are integral to activities where students learn to generate and evaluate knowledge, clarify concepts and ideas, seek possibilities, consider alternatives and solve problems. Critical and creative thinking are embedded in the skills and processes of Working Scientifically. In order to make evidence-based decisions, students are provided with opportunities to develop critical and creative thinking skills through: asking and posing questions; making predictions; engaging in practical and secondary-sourced investigations; and analysing and evaluating evidence.

| **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** | Aboriginal Peoples are the first peoples of Australia and are represented by over 250 language groups each associated with a particular Country or territory. Torres Strait Islander Peoples whose island territories to the north east of Australia were annexed by Queensland in 1879 are also Indigenous Australians and are represented by five cultural groups. An Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person is someone who: -   is of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent -   identifies as an Aboriginal person and/or Torres Strait Islander person, and -   is accepted as such by the Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander community in which they live. |
