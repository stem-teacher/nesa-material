# Introduction

## Stage 6 Curriculum

NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) Stage 6 syllabuses have been developed to provide students with opportunities to further develop skills which will assist in the next stage of their lives.

The purpose of Stage 6 syllabuses is to:

-   develop a solid foundation of literacy and numeracy

-   provide a curriculum structure which encourages students to complete secondary education at their highest possible level

-   foster the intellectual, creative, ethical and social development of students, in particular relating to:

    -   application of knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes in the fields of study they choose

    -   capacity to manage their own learning and to become flexible, independent thinkers, problem-solvers and decision-makers

    -   capacity to work collaboratively with others

    -   respect for the cultural diversity of Australian society

    -   desire to continue learning in formal or informal settings after school

-   provide a flexible structure within which students can meet the challenges of and prepare for:

    -   further academic study, vocational training and employment

    -   changing workplaces, including an increasingly STEM-focused (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce

    -   full and active participation as global citizens

-   provide formal assessment and certification of students' achievements

-   promote the development of students' values, identity and self-respect.

The Stage 6 syllabuses reflect the principles of the NESA *K–10 Curriculum Framework* and *Statement of Equity Principles*, the reforms of the NSW Government *Stronger HSC Standards* (2016), and nationally agreed educational goals. These syllabuses build on the continuum of learning developed in the K–10 syllabuses.

The syllabuses provide a set of broad learning outcomes that summarise the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes important for students to succeed in and beyond their schooling. In particular, the attainment of skills in literacy and numeracy needed for further study, employment and active participation in society are provided in the syllabuses in alignment with the *Australian Core Skills Framework* (ACSF).

The Stage 6 syllabuses include the content of the Australian curriculum and additional descriptions that clarify the scope and depth of learning in each subject.

NESA syllabuses support a standards-referenced approach to assessment by detailing the important knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes students will develop and outlining clear standards of what students are expected to know and be able to do. The syllabuses take into account the diverse needs of all students and provide structures and processes by which teachers can provide continuity of study for all students.

## Diversity of Learners

NSW Stage 6 syllabuses are inclusive of the learning needs of all students. Syllabuses accommodate teaching approaches that support student diversity, including students with special education needs, gifted and talented students, and students learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). Students may have more than one learning need.

### Students with Special Education Needs

All students are entitled to participate in and progress through the curriculum. Schools are required to provide additional support or adjustments to teaching, learning and assessment activities for some students with special education needs. [Adjustments](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/Diversity-in-learning/stage-6-special-education/adjustments) are measures or actions taken in relation to teaching, learning and assessment that enable a student with special education needs to access syllabus outcomes and content, and demonstrate achievement of outcomes.

Students with special education needs can access the outcomes and content from Stage 6 syllabuses in a range of ways. Students may engage with:

-   Stage 6 syllabus outcomes and content with adjustments to teaching, learning and/or assessment activities; or

-   selected Stage 6 Life Skills outcomes and content from one or more Stage 6 Life Skills syllabuses.

Decisions regarding curriculum options, including adjustments, should be made in the context of [collaborative curriculum planning](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/Diversity-in-learning/stage-6-special-education/collaborative-curriculum-planning) with the student, parent/carer and other significant individuals to ensure that decisions are appropriate for the learning needs and priorities of individual students.

The *Science Life Skills Stage 6 Syllabus* has been developed from the rationale, aim and objectives of the *Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus*.

Further information can be found in support materials for:

-   Investigating Science

-   Special education needs

-   Life Skills.

### Gifted and Talented Students

Gifted students have specific learning needs that may require adjustments to the pace, level and content of the curriculum. Differentiated educational opportunities assist in meeting the needs of gifted students.

Generally, gifted students demonstrate the following characteristics:

-   the capacity to learn at faster rates

-   the capacity to find and solve problems

-   the capacity to make connections and manipulate abstract ideas.

There are different kinds and levels of giftedness. Gifted and talented students may also possess learning difficulties and/or disabilities that should be addressed when planning appropriate teaching, learning and assessment activities.

Curriculum strategies for gifted and talented students may include:

-   differentiation: modifying the pace, level and content of teaching, learning and assessment activities

-   acceleration: promoting a student to a level of study beyond their age group

-   curriculum compacting: assessing a student's current level of learning and addressing aspects of the curriculum that have not yet been mastered.

School decisions about appropriate strategies are generally collaborative and involve teachers, parents and students with reference to documents and advice available from NESA and the education sectors.

Gifted and talented students may also benefit from individual planning to determine the curriculum options, as well as teaching, learning and assessment strategies, most suited to their needs and abilities.

### Students Learning English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D)

Many students in Australian schools are learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). EAL/D students are those whose first language is a language or dialect other than Standard Australian English and who require additional support to assist them to develop English language proficiency.

EAL/D students come from diverse backgrounds and may include:

-   overseas and Australian-born students whose first language is a language other than English, including creoles and related varieties

-   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students whose first language is Aboriginal English, including Kriol and related varieties.

EAL/D students enter Australian schools at different ages and stages of schooling and at different stages of English language learning. They have diverse talents and capabilities and a range of prior learning experiences and levels of literacy in their first language and in English. EAL/D students represent a significant and growing percentage of learners in NSW schools. For some, school is the only place they use Standard Australian English.

EAL/D students are simultaneously learning a new language and the knowledge, understanding and skills of the *Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus* through that new language. They may require additional support, along with informed teaching that explicitly addresses their language needs.

The *ESL Scales* and the [*English as an Additional Language or Dialect: Teacher Resource*](http://www.acara.edu.au/curriculum/student-diversity/english-as-an-additional-Language-or-dialect) provide information about the English language development phases of EAL/D students. These materials and other resources can be used to support the specific needs of English language learners and to assist students to access syllabus outcomes and content.

# Investigating Science Key

The following codes and icons are used in the *Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus*.

# Rationale

The *Investigating Science Stage 6* *Syllabus* is designed to assist students of all abilities engage with scientific processes, and apply those processes to investigate relevant personal, community and global scientific issues.

The ongoing study of science and the specific Working Scientifically skills processes and their application have led humans to accumulate an evidence-based body of knowledge about human interactions – past, present and future – with the world and its galactic neighbourhood. The course is firmly focused on developing the Working Scientifically skills, as they provide a foundation for students to value investigation, solve problems, develop and communicate evidence-based arguments, and make informed decisions.

The course promotes active inquiry and explores key concepts, models and phenomena. It draws and builds on the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes gained in Science Stage 5. The Stage 6 course is designed to enhance students' understanding of the value of evidence-based investigations and the use of science-based inquiry in their lives.

The Investigating Science course is designed to complement the study of the science disciplines by providing additional opportunities for students to investigate and develop an understanding of scientific concepts, their current and future uses, and their impacts on science and society. The course draws on and promotes interdisciplinary science, by allowing students to investigate a wide range of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related issues and concepts in depth.

Investigating Science encourages the development of a range of capabilities and capacities that enhance a student's ability to participate in all aspects of community life and within a fast-changing technological landscape. The knowledge, understanding and skills gained from this course are intended to support students' ongoing engagement with science, and to form the foundation for further studies and participation in current and emerging STEM-related post-school activities and industries.

||
|The Working Scientifically outcomes and content are integrated into each module wherever students undertake an investigation.|
||
|## Working Scientifically|
||
|Working Scientifically skills are at the core of conducting practical and secondary-sourced investigations in science.|
||
|Opportunities should be provided for students to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills in investigations. In each module, particular outcomes have been identified as those that are most relevant to the intended learning.|
||
|Students are challenged to further develop their understanding of Working Scientifically as a group of dynamic and interdependent processes that are applied in each scientific investigation in a way that is appropriate and determined by the activity. This dynamism and interrelatedness adds a level of sophistication to students' understanding of the true nature and practice of science. Through regular involvement in these processes, applying them as appropriate, in a range of varied practical investigations, students can broaden their interpretation of Working Scientifically beyond the common linear model.|
||
|Students are encouraged to select the most appropriate gateway to the Working Scientifically processes. The pathways within the processes become self-evident through the nature of the investigation. An investigation may be instigated by, for example:|
||
|-   direct observation of a phenomenon|
||
|-   inconsistencies arising from results of a related investigation|
||
|-   the quantitative and qualitative analysis of data|
||
|-   secondary-sourced research.|
||
|Students are challenged to be open to:|
||
|-   refining or redeveloping their chosen procedures|
||
|-   redefining their questions and/or hypotheses|
||
|-   modifying their methodologies or designs|
||
|-   conducting further practical investigations|
||
|-   conducting further secondary research.|
||
|Students are also encouraged to communicate evidence-based conclusions and suggest ideas for future research. Unexpected results are to be welcomed to refine methodologies and to generate further investigation. Knowledge and understanding of science is essential to these processes. Through this practice of science, students can acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts.|
||

Wrapping around the main diagram is a double ended arrow pointing to a circle labelled Knowledge and Understanding.](media/image18.png "Working Scientifically diagram"){width="6.260416666666667in" height="6.5625in"}|
||
|Each of the seven Working Scientifically outcomes represents one of the interdependent dynamic processes that are central to the study of science and the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills. This course is structured to provide ongoing opportunities for students to implement these processes, particularly through the depth study provision. The following descriptions of the Working Scientifically outcomes provide further information about the skills students are expected to develop throughout the course.|
||
|### Questioning and Predicting|
||
|[Developing, proposing and evaluating inquiry questions and hypotheses challenge students to identify an issue or phenomenon that can be investigated scientifically by gathering primary and/or secondary-sourced data. Students develop inquiry question(s) that require observations, experimentation and/or research to aid in constructing a reasonable and informed hypothesis. The consideration of variables is to be included in the questioning process.]{.mark}|
||
|### Planning Investigations|
||
|Students justify the selection of equipment, resources chosen and design of an investigation. They ensure that all risks are assessed, appropriate materials and technologies are sourced, and all ethical concerns are considered. Variables are to be identified as independent, dependent and controlled to ensure a valid procedure is developed that will allow for the reliable collection of data. Investigations should include strategies that ensure controlled variables are kept constant and an experimental control is used as appropriate.|
||
|### Conducting Investigations|
||
|Students are to select appropriate equipment, employ safe work practices and ensure that risk assessments are conducted and followed. Appropriate technologies are to be used and procedures followed when disposing of waste. The selection and criteria for collecting valid and reliable data is to be methodical and, where appropriate, secondary-sourced information referenced correctly.|
||
|### Processing Data and Information|
||
|Students use the most appropriate and meaningful methods and media to organise and analyse data and information sources, including digital technologies and the use of a variety of visual representations as appropriate. They process data from primary and secondary sources, including both qualitative and quantitative data and information.|
||
|### Analysing Data and Information|
||
|Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations. They evaluate processes, claims and conclusions by considering the quality of available evidence, and use reasoning to construct scientific arguments. Where appropriate, mathematical models are to be applied, to demonstrate the trends and relationships that occur in data.|
||
|### Problem Solving|
||
|Students use critical thinking skills and creativity to demonstrate an understanding of scientific principles underlying the solutions to inquiry questions and problems posed in investigations. Appropriate and varied strategies are employed, including the use of models to qualitatively and quantitatively explain and predict cause-and-effect relationships. In Working Scientifically, students synthesise and use evidence to construct and justify conclusions. To solve problems, students: interpret scientific and media texts; evaluate processes, claims and conclusions; and consider the quality of available evidence.|
||
|### Communicating|
||
|Communicating all components of the Working Scientifically processes with clarity and accuracy is essential. Students use qualitative and quantitative information gained from investigations using primary and secondary sources, including digital, visual, written and/or verbal forms of communication as appropriate. They apply appropriate scientific notations and nomenclature. They also appropriately apply and use scientific language that is suitable for specific audiences and contexts.|
||
|## Investigations|
||
|An investigation is a scientific process to answer a question, explore an idea or solve a problem. Investigations include activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, processing and analysing data, reaching a conclusion and communicating. Investigations may include the collection of primary and/or secondary-sourced data or information.|
||
|Practical investigations involve the collection of primary data. They may include:|
||
|-   undertaking laboratory investigations, including fair tests and controlled experiments|
||
|-   undertaking fieldwork and surveys|
||
|-   constructing models.|
||
|Secondary-sourced investigations can include:|
||
|-   researching by using a variety of media|
||
|-   extracting and reorganising secondary-sourced information in the form of flow charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, prose, keys, spreadsheets and databases|
||
|-   using models to inform understanding.|
||
|### Safety|
||
|Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers will need to ensure that they comply with relevant legislation as well as system and school requirements in relation to safety when implementing their programs. This includes legislation and guidelines relating to Work Health and Safety, and the handling and storage of chemical and dangerous goods.|
||
|### Animal Research|
||
|Schools have a legal responsibility in relation to the welfare of animals. The keeping of animals and all practical activities involving animals must comply with relevant guidelines or legislation.|
||
|## Inquiry Questions|

|INS11-8|
||
|**Related Life Skills outcomes:** SCLS6-1, SCLS6-3, SCLS6-4, SCLS6-8|
||
|### Content Focus|
||
|Observation instigates all scientific experimentation. Investigative scientific processes can only be applied to phenomena that can be observed and measured. Detailed observations motivate scientists to ask questions about the causes and the effects of phenomena they observe. In this way, science continues to progress and enhance the lives of individuals and society by encouraging a continued search for reason and understanding.|
||
|Students explore the importance of observation and the collection of quantitative and qualitative data in scientific investigations. They conduct their own practical investigation, either individually or collaboratively, which is used to demonstrate the importance of making detailed and accurate observations, determining the types of variables and formulating testable scientific hypotheses.|
||
|### Working Scientifically|
||
|In this module, students focus on developing hypotheses that arise from their observations and evaluate these in order to gather, select and process appropriate qualitative and quantitative data. Students should be provided with opportunities to engage with all Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.|

|**Related Life Skills outcomes:** SCLS6-1, SCLS6-2, SCLS6-4, SCLS6-9|
||
|### Content Focus|
||
|Scientific inquiry follows on from humans making inferences and generalisations from commonly held understandings. Such inferences and generalisations have led to a wide range of investigations being performed throughout history, culminating in breakthroughs in scientific understanding. Many hypotheses, when found to be correct, have generated further inquiry and created the need to develop new technologies for further observation.|
||
|Students consider primary and secondary-sourced data and its influence on scientific investigations. In this module, students engage in gathering primary and secondary-sourced data to assist them in conducting and reporting on investigations, and to further develop their understanding of the central roles of scientific questioning and collaboration in the pursuit of scientific truth.|
||
|### Working Scientifically|

|**Related Life Skills outcomes:** SCLS6-2, SCLS6-3, SCLS6-4, SCLS6-10|
||
|### Content Focus|
||
|Scientific models are developed as a means of helping people understand scientific concepts and representing them in a visual medium. Models are used to make predictions. They may include physical and digital models, which can be refined over time by the inclusion of new scientific knowledge.|
||
|Students recognise that many scientific models have limitations and are modified as further evidence comes to light. For this reason, scientific models are continually evaluated for accuracy and applicability by the global scientific community through the process of peer review. Students construct and evaluate their own models, which are generated through practical investigation.|
||
|### Working Scientifically|

|### Content Focus|
||
|[The term 'science' comes from the Latin *scientia*, which means 'a knowledge based on demonstrable]{.mark} and reproducible data'. Reproducible data is used by scientists to develop theories and laws to explain and describe phenomena. Theories provide a coherent understanding of a wide range of phenomena. A law is usually a statement that can be expressed as a mathematical relationship. It describes phenomena in nature, with no exceptions, at a point in time. Testing scientific theories drives scientific breakthroughs and questions current understandings.|
||
|Students examine how complex models and theories often require a wide range of evidence, which impacts on society and the environment. In this module, students engage in practical and secondary investigations that are related to major theories or laws and their application.|

### Content Focus

Students learn that the experimental method is a dynamic process influenced by initial observations, new evidence, unexpected results or phenomena arising from the investigation. They examine the interrelated roles of practical and secondary-sourced investigations. When conducting practical and secondary-sourced investigations, students use peer feedback to refine their investigative designs and report on their findings.

Students explore the importance of accuracy, validity and reliability in relation to the investigative work of a scientist. They examine the differences between a scientific investigation and a scientific report, recognising that although the report format follows a sequential order, the investigation need not.

### Working Scientifically

In this module, students focus on: developing and evaluating hypotheses and questions; designing and evaluating investigations; and undertaking valid scientific investigations. Students should be provided with opportunities to engage with all Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.

**Related Life Skills outcomes:** SCLS6-4, SCLS6-5, SCLS6-6, SCLS6-7, SCLS6-13

### Content Focus

The scientific process is the most powerful tool available for generating knowledge about the world. It uses evidence and measurement to find truth and highlight misinterpretations and misrepresentations. Science as a human endeavour is subject to human failings, which can contribute to fallacies, misinterpretations and, on occasion, fraud. For this reason, scientific processes attempt to compensate for human failings by questioning evidence, re-testing ideas, replicating results and engaging with peer review in order to evaluate research.

Students investigate claims through conducting practical and secondary-sourced investigations and evaluate these based on scientific evidence. They explore examples of scientific claims made in the media and investigate the benefits of peer review.

### Working Scientifically

In this module, students focus on selecting, processing, analysing and evaluating primary and secondary data and information sources. Students communicate scientific understanding and information about factual or fallacious claims. Students should be provided with opportunities to engage with all Working Scientifically skills throughout the course.

### Content Focus

Those who pursue the study of science have created processes, tools and products that challenge and influence society and some of its belief systems, ethics and societal norms. In response, society debates and regulates science in order to prevent harmful developments and unacceptable outcomes, and to allow for new and beneficial products, processes and ideas. Science also can be affected by society, as well as governments, industry, economic interests and cultural perspectives.

Students explore the impacts of ethical, social, economic and political influences on science and its research.
