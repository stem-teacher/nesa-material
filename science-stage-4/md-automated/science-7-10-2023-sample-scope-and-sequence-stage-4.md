| Students explore the nature and practice of science as a set of processes used to observe and build a body of knowledge about the Universe and the world around us. They draw on observations relevant to their own lives to develop questions about the world around them and to find answers to these questions by making observations using their senses, tools and technologies. Students explore the types of observations made and used by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples to understand their environment, including weather patterns and tides. Students develop an understanding of how observations, experimentation and analysis allow us to build up a knowledge of the Universe. Students explore the collaborative and interdisciplinary practice of science as they research how a recent advancement in science has increased our knowledge of the world and the Universe. |

| Students explore the effects of direct and indirect forces, including gravity, electrostatic forces and magnetism. They investigate the use of force diagrams, analyse the relationship between force and energy, and explore the practical applications of simple machines in everyday life, all within the context of forces and magnetism. |

| Students learn the physical properties of the 3 states of matter with a specific focus on the properties of water. They learn to distinguish between atoms, mixtures and compounds, and how different types of mixtures can be separated based on their physical properties. Students develop skills in problem-solving, planning and conducting investigations. They investigate the physical properties of water and how it can change state. Students explore the density of water and other solutions using a mathematical formula. They examine how different types and concentrations of solutions are formed. Students explore how to separate mixtures based on an understanding of their physical properties and how separation techniques are used in everyday activities. |

| Students develop their understanding of multicellular organisms and how they interact in ecosystems. They focus on the role of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory and excretory systems of humans, and the role of the xylem and phloem in multicellular plants. Students develop skills in questioning, predicting, processing data and information, and communicating scientific ideas. They investigate how plants and animals transport nutrients and waste, and develop an understanding of the different specialised cells, tissues and organ systems involved'. Students explore the components of an ecosystem and examine the balance of abiotic and biotic factors. Students also identify how matter and energy are cycled through a system. Using their knowledge of these systems, they predict the impacts on a system if a part is removed. |

| Students explore how matter is everywhere, that it has mass and volume, and it makes up everything on the planet Earth. They learn to explain the properties and uses of common elements and compounds, as well as how to model the atomic structure of the first 18 elements of the periodic table. Students learn how to read the periodic table to identify trends and patterns, and then investigate the properties of materials that influence their uses. They develop a deeper understanding of matter, elements and atoms, and what comprises them. Students learn how to use the periodic table to predict trends and patterns before investigating the availability, properties and uses of specific materials. |

| Students explore energy transfers, including conduction, convection and radiation, and the distinctions between them. They learn about various energy storage systems, such as thermal, elastic, chemical and gravitational energy, and how energy is transferred between these forms. In the Chemical Change content group, students learn to identify physical and chemical change indicators and observe energy changes in reactions. In the Geological Change content group, students learn about plate tectonics, earthquakes and volcanoes, as well as Aboriginal Peoples' accounts of geological phenomena. They explore minerals, rocks, the rock cycle, fossil formation and the elemental composition of the Earth. Students develop a holistic understanding of the concept of change. |

| Students broaden their understanding of how data is used in science, including in the development of scientific models (for example, predicting movement of celestial objects and weather patterns). They build on their problem-solving skills by proposing solutions and recognising data that supports or refutes identified predictions. Students explore diverse data sources and their practical uses, ranging from experimental and big data to digital technology. By recognising the significance of responsible online engagement, students learn to assess the digital footprint generated by various online activities. They learn that data science integrates statistics, scientific methods, algorithms and systems to extract insights from data. Students study scientific models, recognising them as representations of real-world phenomena. They identify model types utilised by scientists, assess data, and make predictions. Students explore data-driven processes, formulate investigable questions and analyse data for patterns. Through this content, students develop skills in creating models to explain observable phenomena, enabling them to engage critically with data and scientific representation. |
