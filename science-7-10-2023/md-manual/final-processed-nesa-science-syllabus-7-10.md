## Implementation from 2026

The new Science 7--10 Syllabus (2023) is to be implemented from 2026.

**2024 and 2025** -- Plan and prepare to teach the new syllabus

**2026** -- Start teaching new syllabus

School sectors are responsible for implementing syllabuses and are best
placed to provide schools with specific guidance and information on
implementation given their understanding of their individual contexts.

## Aim

The aim of the *Science 7--10 Syllabus* is to:

-   develop students' curiosity about, and interest in, science and the
    natural world

<!-- -->

-   increase students' knowledge and understanding of the nature and
    practice of science, and the Working scientifically processes

<!-- -->

-   encourage students to generate and analyse data, evaluate results,
    and make ethical, evidence-based decisions, as informed, reflective
    and scientifically literate citizens.

## Table of outcomes

*The table below displays the Science 7--10 focus areas and their
associated outcomes. The relationship between Stage 4 and 5 and Life
Skills outcomes is shown in the Related Life Skills column. Life Skills
focus areas and their associated outcomes are listed in full in the Life
Skills section of the syllabus.*

##### Data science 2 in context

-   Use data to make evidence-based decisions about a familiar issue and
    assess the implications of these decisions

##  Assessment

The primary role of assessment is to establish where students are in
their learning so that teaching can be differentiated and further
learning progress can be monitored over time. It provides information
that assists teachers to target their teaching at the point of student
need. Assessment is most effective when it is an integral part of
teaching and learning programs.

Assessment involves:

-   establishing where students are in their learning

-   ongoing monitoring

-   formative and summative tasks

-   providing feedback about student progress.

### Common Grade Scale

**Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4, Stage 5**

The [[common grade
scale]{.underline}](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/understanding-the-curriculum/awarding-grades/common-grade-scale)
can be used to report student achievement in both primary and junior
secondary years in all NSW schools.

### Course performance descriptors

**Stage 5 -- Year 10**

Course performance descriptors provide holistic descriptions of typical
achievement at different grade levels in a specific course. They are
used to identify and report a student's level of achievement in a Board
Developed Course at the end of Stage 5.

#### Grade A

A student performing at this grade typically:

-   demonstrates extensive knowledge and understanding of scientific
    models, theories and laws

    practice of science in a range of contexts

-   identifies and develops valid scientific hypotheses and questions to
    make evidence-based predictions

-   designs appropriate, safe, ethical, valid and reliable scientific
    investigations and effectively follows plans to conduct
    investigations

-   analyses data and synthesises information to draw evidence-based
    scientific conclusions about trends, patterns and relationships

-   selects and applies a range of suitable problem-solving strategies
    and evaluates and compares proposed solutions to scientific problems

### Assessment of Life Skills outcomes

**Stage 4, Stage 5**

The syllabus outcomes and content form the basis of learning
opportunities for students. Through the [[collaborative curriculum
planning
process]{.underline}](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/collaborative-curriculum-planning),
teachers select specific Life Skills outcomes which are based on the
needs, strengths, goals, interests and prior learning of each student.
Students are required to demonstrate achievement of one or more Life
Skills outcomes.

Assessment should provide opportunities for students to demonstrate
achievement in relation to the selected outcomes. Assessment can occur
in a range of situations or environments such as the school and wider
community. Evidence of achievement can be based on:

-   [[formative]{.underline}](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/assessment-and-reporting/formative-assessment)
    assessment opportunities

-   [[summative]{.underline}](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/assessment-and-reporting/summative-assessment)
    assessment opportunities.

There is no requirement for formal assessment of Life Skills outcomes.
Stage 6 Life Skills courses do not have external examinations or
mandatory projects.
