### Assessment of Life Skills outcomes

**Stage 4, Stage 5**

The syllabus outcomes and content form the basis of learning
opportunities for students. Through the [[collaborative curriculum
planning
process]{.underline}](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/collaborative-curriculum-planning),
teachers select specific Life Skills outcomes which are based on the
needs, strengths, goals, interests and prior learning of each student.
Students are required to demonstrate achievement of one or more Life
Skills outcomes.

Assessment should provide opportunities for students to demonstrate
achievement in relation to the selected outcomes. Assessment can occur
in a range of situations or environments such as the school and wider
community. Evidence of achievement can be based on:

-   [[formative]{.underline}](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/assessment-and-reporting/formative-assessment)
    assessment opportunities

-   [[summative]{.underline}](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/assessment-and-reporting/summative-assessment)
    assessment opportunities.

There is no requirement for formal assessment of Life Skills outcomes.
Stage 6 Life Skills courses do not have external examinations or
mandatory projects.
