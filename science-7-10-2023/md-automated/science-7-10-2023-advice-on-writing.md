# Science 7–10 (2023): Stages 4 and 5 – Advice on writing

## Creating written texts across the curriculum

A written text could be a sentence, paragraph or more extended text. Creating written texts facilitates learning as it promotes explicit communication, encourages integration of ideas, supports reflection, fosters personal engagement and helps students to think about the significance and implication of ideas. Creating written texts refers to the act of composing and constructing texts for a particular purpose, audience and context. Various methods of transcription may be employed and a student's [preferred communication form(s)](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/diversity-in-learning/special-education/adjustments) should be considered when teaching writing. Writing about content enhances understanding across subjects and stages of learning.

In designing learning opportunities for students, teachers should consider how students' creation of written texts can serve as a tool for students to develop and communicate their understanding of key principles in the subject.

### Creating written texts to develop understanding

Many writing activities can be designed to help develop students' understanding of subject content. Tasks are often completed in short sections and result in an informal written product. The intended audience is primarily the student but might also include their peers and the teacher.

These activities can help students to build and consolidate knowledge, generate ideas, engage personally, challenge assumptions and articulate complex understanding.

### Creating written texts to communicate understanding

More formal writing activities often serve the purpose of communicating information, ideas and arguments to an implied or real audience beyond the classroom. The types of texts that result from this work tend to take specific forms, governed by recognisable codes and conventions of the field of study. In these tasks, students are expected to learn and reproduce organisational and linguistic features typical of the specific type of text.

Creating a specific type of text can help students in developing a more complex understanding of subject content. By focusing on the purpose of communicating their understanding, students are also encouraged to consider the importance of ideas and arguments beyond the classroom.

# Sample: Advice on writing

## Creating written texts in Science 7–10

The following are some examples of how syllabus content on creating written texts can be addressed in the classroom. To demonstrate different ways of using writing to assist students' learning, examples describe approaches for **writing to develop understanding** and **writing to communicate understanding**.

### Example 1:

### Written explanation – developing understanding (Stage 4)

When students are creating written explanations to accompany visual information as a part of learning new information, they are writing to **develop understanding**. This process helps students to process and consolidate knowledge.

Some cultures or languages may have preference for low modality. Representing the strength of modal verbs such as on a modal cline may support some EAL/D learners to select the appropriate verb to represent the possibility of a course of action. |

| **Possible context of learning**      | As a part of their study of DNA structure, function and variation, students have researched a range of genetic technologies to examine their applications and implications for use. Students have learned about the application of ethical frameworks through investigation of Henrietta Lacks and the scientific community's use of the HeLa stem cell line. |

| **Possible context of learning**      | As a part of their study of nuclear reactions, students have learned to describe the process and products of nuclear decay. They have plotted a half-life curve and compared fission and fusion using annotated diagrams. They have also discussed the structure and function of a nuclear reactor. Students have explored ethical issues associated with the concept of radioactivity, including the use of radioisotopes in medical procedures. |

## Strategies for supporting writing

Strategies for the explicit teaching of writing should be selected based on the learning needs of each student, which might include:

-   building the context or field – reading, viewing, listening to a range of short texts to engage with key concepts, relevant background information, content and vocabulary that build knowledge and understanding, including:

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   group discussion and/or debate of key ideas and issues to prompt personal engagement

-   analysis of selected examples and case studies, including note-making and annotation

-   guided and independent research

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   modelling – engaging with the writing demands of model texts to deepen understanding, including:

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   analysis and annotation of model texts, such as sample and exemplar responses, to familiarise students with typical text features

-   co-development of a writing plan and/or scaffold using success criteria

-   provision of support materials, such as word banks, graphic organisers, sentence-starters and writing prompts, to target the use of key language and ideas

-   joint construction of sample responses to model processes and decision-making

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   independent practice – applying knowledge, understanding and skills to develop independent writing, including:

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   planning, monitoring, revising and reflecting in recursive phases

-   seeking, evaluating and implementing feedback

### Supporting EAL/D learners

EAL/D learners enter Australian schools at different ages and stages of schooling, at any time during the academic year and at different stages of English language learning. They may also have varying levels of literacy in their home language or dialect and may be continuing to learn the writing conventions of their own language while simultaneously developing language skills in English. EAL/D learners may produce writing that is commensurate with their level of [language progression](https://docs.acara.edu.au/resources/EALD_Learning_Progression.pdf) and which may not reflect the extent of their knowledge, understanding and skills in the subject.

Many Aboriginal students in NSW use Aboriginal English as their home dialect. This means that they may require additional EAL/D support.

EAL/D learners may require specific support to develop writing skills, particularly students at early phases of English language learning. Along with the strategies listed above, the following may be required:

-   enabling students to use their home language or dialect to build their field of understanding, and talk about and plan their writing

-   making connections between grammatical structures in English and their home language or dialect.
