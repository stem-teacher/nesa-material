Purpose
The Working scientifically processes are an integral component of the Science 7–10 Syllabus (2023) and
are embedded in the outcomes and content. Students learn to work scientifically by using these processes
in an interconnected way through regular participation in a range of practical experiences.
Through Working scientifically, students extend their understanding of the nature of science and how
scientific ideas, explanations and concepts develop through the processes of scientific inquiry. They learn
to understand the unique interdisciplinary nature of science and the importance of scientific evidence in
making informed decisions.
The Science 7–10: Working scientifically processes guide is designed to support teachers in embedding
Working scientifically processes in their planning. The guide provides teachers with activities linked to
Working scientifically processes and focus areas. Some students with disability may require adjustments to
access scientific investigations and engage in Working scientifically processes.
The appendices include examples and conventions related to different representations that are used in
Science 7–10, the structure of a practical written report for a scientific investigation, and an example of a
method for a scientific investigation.

Image long description: Scatter plot titled ‘Air density versus temperature’. Evenly spaced horizontal
lines are counted in multiples of 0.1 from 0.8 to a maximum of 1.4. The horizontal lines are attached to
the y-axis, which is labelled ‘Density (kg/m3)’ and has a discontinuity marker from 0 to 0.8. Vertical lines
are counted in multiples of 20 to a maximum of 100. The vertical lines are attached to the x-axis, which
is labelled ‘Temperature (°C)’. A solid, straight line of best fit is drawn diagonally, sloping downwards
from (0, 1.3) to (100, 0.91). Data points plotted at each temperature interval starting from zero are
marked with a x and appear just above or below the line of best fit. A vertical dashed line joins the line of
best fit to the x-axis at the position marking 50°C. A horizontal dashed line joins the line of best fit to the
y-axis at 1.1kg/m3.


Conventions
▪              Values that are not measured are estimated.
▪              This is only valid for estimated variables within the plotted range of measurements.
▪              A dotted line is drawn with a ruler from a point on either the x or y axis to the line of best fit, and then
               directly across or down to a point on the other axis. The two points where the dotted line joins both
               axes are the corresponding estimated values.

Image long description: Scatter plot titled ‘Boiling point of alkanes’. Evenly spaced horizontal lines are
counted in multiples of 50 from −200 to a maximum of +200. The horizontal lines are attached to the y-
axis, which is labelled ‘Boiling point (°C)’. Every second vertical line is labelled in multiples of 1 from zero
to a maximum of 8. Vertical lines are attached to the x-axis, which is labelled ‘Number of carbon atoms’.
A solid straight line of best fit is drawn diagonally, sloping upwards from (1, – 148) to (6, 80) and
continuing as a dashed line with the same slope to (8, 172). A vertical dashed line joins the dashed line
of best fit to the x-axis at the position marking 7 carbon atoms. A horizontal dashed line joins the dashed
line of best fit to the y-axis at the position labelled 125°C.


Conventions
▪   Values that are outside a plotted range of measurements are estimated.
▪   This is only valid for data that follows a consistent trend.
▪   A dotted line is drawn with a ruler from a point on either the x or y axis to the extended line of best
    fit, and then directly across or down to a point on the other axis. The two points where the dotted
    line joins both axes are the corresponding estimated values.

Image long description: Scatter plot with no title. Every second horizontal line is labelled, in multiples of
10 from 20 to 40. The horizontal lines are attached to the y-axis, which is labelled ‘Voltage (volts)’ and
has a discontinuity marker from 0 to 20. Vertical lines are not evenly spaced and are labelled 10, 17 and
34 from the origin. The vertical lines are attached to the x-axis, which is labelled ‘Current (mA)’. A line is
drawn to connect the origin to (17, 30) through (10, 20) and then to continue with a change in gradient to
connect to (34, 40). Four data points are plotted using a dot.


Graph errors (first example)
▪   The title is missing.
▪   The x-axis scale divisions are inconsistent.
▪   The y-axis is not labelled with the correct unit of measurement
▪   Data points are not plotted with ‘x’ symbol.
▪   The line of best fit does not have a constant gradient.
▪   The location of (0,0) is not at the intersection of the x and y axis and zero is not marked on either
    axis.

                                   Figure 7: Second example of an incorrect graph

Image long description: Scatter plot with no title. Evenly spaced horizontal lines are labelled from 10 at
the origin, counting by 20 to a maximum of 210. The horizontal lines are attached to the y-axis, which is
labelled ‘Voltage’. Vertical lines are evenly spaced and are labelled in multiples of 10 from zero to 50.
The vertical lines are attached to the x-axis, which is labelled ‘Current (mA)’. A solid straight line of best
fit is drawn from the junction of the x-axis and y-axis to (30, 100) on the graph. Seven data points,
labelled ‘x’, are clustered around the line, with 4 points above the line, one below the line and 2 on the
line of best fit.


Graph errors (second example)
▪   The title is missing.
▪   The axes are labelled inconsistently, with the y-axis missing the unit symbol.
▪   The line of best fit does not represent a trend.
▪   The y-axis does not start at (0,0).
▪   The scale should be adjusted so plotted points fill more of the grid space.

Image long description: Compound column graph, titled ‘Birds observed in schoolyard’, showing the
number of birds observed at different times of the day. The x-axis represents 4 time intervals of one hour
between 8 am and 3 pm. The y-axis represents the number of birds observed, ranging from 0 to 35.
Three bird species are represented in the stacked bars: Australian raven, Noisy miner, and Sparrow.
The height of the bars shows that the number of observed birds fluctuates throughout the day, peaking
between 2 pm and 3 pm when about 35 birds are observed. Shading in the bars corresponding to each
bird species shows how the composition of species varies across time intervals.

Image long description: Column graph, titled ‘Annual mean temperature anomaly’, shows annual mean
temperatures and their recorded deviation from the baseline (0.0), which is stated as the average of
temperatures between 1961 and 1990. The x-axis is in years, starting at 1910 and ending at 2010. The
y-axis is the ‘mean temperature anomaly (°C)’, ranging from −1.5 to +1.5 (°C). The vertical bars
represent yearly temperature anomalies, with the dark bars indicating positive anomalies (warmer than
the baseline) and light bars showing negative anomalies (cooler than the baseline). A steady upward
trend in temperature anomalies is evident over the decades, particularly from the early 1980s, when the
anomalies shift from negative to positive. A bold line traces the 11-year average, highlighting the overall
warming trend. By 2010, the temperature anomaly reaches just over +1.0°C, indicating the average
global temperature increase since 1910.

Image long description: A dichotomous key which shows how the physical features of invertebrates
found in leaf litter can be used to identify them. The key includes text describing traits of the
invertebrates used to make classification decisions. The most general group is labelled ‘Phylum
Arthropoda’ and contains all the invertebrates listed. This group branches to ‘Class Arachnida’, ‘Class
Insecta’, ‘Class Crustacea’, ‘Class Diplopoda’ and ‘Class Chilopoda’. Drawings of a scorpion,
pseudoscorpion, mite, spider, springtail, earwig, bug, beetle, ant, slater, amphipod, millipede and
centipede are shown as the final step to classify the invertebrates.


Conventions
▪     Junctions show choices based on features.
▪     Each organism can be uniquely identified using the branching choices.
▪     The ‘di-’ prefix in ‘dichotomous’ indicates 2 choices at each junction.

experiment work?’. Here, arrows point downwards to circles labelled ‘No’ and ‘Yes’. From ‘No’, an arrow
points horizontally to ‘Modify the procedure’, which leads back to ‘Test the hypothesis with an
experiment’. ‘Yes’ points downwards to ‘Analyse the data and make conclusions’, with 2 arrows pointing
downwards to ‘Results align with hypothesis’ and ‘Results do not align with hypothesis’. Both of these
lead to a final destination of ‘Communicate results’, with arrows from ‘Results do not align with
hypothesis’ also pointing upwards to ‘The experiment is not a failure’ and then ‘Make a hypothesis’.


Conventions
▪   The text in the shapes contains a specific action, function or outcome.
▪   Arrows show decision-making.
▪   The final shape represents the end of the process or procedure.

                                   Figure 29: Example of a polar-area diagram

Image long description: A circular diagram titled ‘Based on Florence Nightingale’s polar area diagram’,
with a corresponding key to the left. The key lists causes of death including ‘Preventable disease’,
‘Wounds’ and ‘All other causes’. The diagram has 12 segments of equal angles but varying size,
labelled in a clockwise direction with months and years from April 1854 through to March 1855. The
label ‘Bulgaria’ is between the segments for June and July 1854, and ‘Crimea’ is between September
and October 1854. The segments are divided into shaded areas that correspond with the items in the
key. ‘Preventable disease’ is represented by light shading. It accounts for the largest area in each
segment, showing it consistently caused the most deaths. ‘Wounds’ and ‘All other causes’ were
interchangeably the second most common cause of death. The fewest deaths occurred in June 1854,
and most deaths in January 1885.


Conventions
▪   The segments represent equal time intervals.
▪   The area of the segments represents the magnitude of the data points.
▪   The shading represents the proportions of the variables.

Safety risks and mitigation
 Risk                                                       Mitigation

 Slipping from spilled water or oil                         Clean any spills immediately and ensure the
                                                            workspace remains clear of hazards.

 Cuts from sharp edges on solids like wax or sand           Handle all materials carefully and wear gloves
                                                            when necessary.


Method
    1.   Ensure safety
             a. Wear safety goggles to protect eyes and ensure the workspace is free from hazards
                such as spills.
             b. Use gloves to avoid direct contact with the substances, particularly when handling
                unfamiliar materials.

    2. Prepare the beakers
             a. Place 5 clean 150 mL beakers next to each other on a flat bench.
             b. Make sure the bench is dry and level to prevent spillage.

    3. Measure the water
             a. Use a 100 mL measuring cylinder to measure exactly 100 mL of water at room
                temperature.
             b. Pour 100 mL of water into each of the 5 beakers.



Science 7–10 (2023): Working scientifically processes guide                                       Page 70 of 71
    4.   Measure the solids
             a. Weigh 5 different solids, each with an equal mass of 5 g (for example, sugar, table
                salt, wax, sand and bread).

    5. Add the solids
             a. Place one solid into each beaker at the same time, to maintain uniform conditions.

    6. Observe the reactions
             a. Allow the solids to remain in the beakers for 10 minutes.
             b. Identify which solids have dissolved, indicating solubility in water. Solids that remain
                visible are insoluble.

    7. Record the data
             a. Document the results in a data table, noting which solids dissolved and which
                remained undissolved.
             b. Include any additional observations, such as changes in water clarity or temperature.

    8. Repeat with oil
             a. Replace the water with oil and repeat steps 2 to 7 to investigate which substances
                are soluble in oil.
             b. Record the results in a new data table, clearly indicating which solvent was used
                (water or oil).

    9. Improve reliability
             a. Repeat the entire experiment at least twice more to increase the consistency and
                reliability of the data.
             b. Compare the results from all trials to check for any inconsistencies or anomalies.
