# Science 7–10 (2023): Stages 4 and 5 – Advice on numeracy

## Numeracy across the curriculum 

Numeracy involves understanding and applying mathematical knowledge and skills in a wide range of contexts. The application of mathematics across the curriculum enriches the study of other learning areas and helps to develop a broader and deeper understanding of numeracy.

A numerate person (Hogan 2000) uses a blend of:

-   mathematical knowledge: concepts and skills within mathematics

-   contextual knowledge: to recognise and link mathematics to broader situations

-   strategic knowledge: to apply mathematics in situations and evaluate if the solution is reasonable. [^1]

Numeracy is a fundamental skill that strengthens learning across all NSW Curriculum areas. While Mathematics provides the foundation for explicit numeracy instruction, other learning areas also play a crucial role. These areas offer opportunities to contextualise, solidify and extend numeracy concepts as students embrace activities rich in numeracy demands.

## Identifying opportunities for numeracy in Science 7–10

Students have opportunities to develop their numeracy capability as they investigate concepts fundamental to science. Below are examples of how mathematical knowledge and skills can be addressed in Science 7–10.

| **Possible teaching and learning activity** | Students explore concepts of force and mass and perform calculations using the formula F = mg. The teacher conducts a pre-assessment activity inviting students to share their knowledge of substitution and find unknown values by using a formula. This activity informs the level of support that students will need to use the formula F = mg.                                                                                                  |

|                                             | The teacher leads a discussion about the concepts of force and mass. The teacher explicitly instructs students how to use the formula to determine weight force. In small groups, students choose different classroom objects. Using a measuring device such as digital scales, students measure the mass of an object. The teacher demonstrates how to use the formula to calculate weight force. Students perform their own calculation, for example: |

|                                             | Using a spring balance or Newton meter, students measure the force (in newtons) that these objects exert when suspended and record this weight force. The teacher demonstrates how to use the formula to calculate mass. Students then perform their own calculation, for example:                                                                                                                                                                      |

Students investigate the relationship between V, I and R and establish Ohm's law. The teacher conducts a short pre-assessment activity to determine student understanding of reading scaled measuring devices, drawing and constructing circuits, directly proportional relationships, and collecting and representing data.                                                                  |

|                                             | In small groups, students set up circuits to record the voltage and current. Students identify the independent variable (voltage) and the dependent variable (current) for this investigation. Students adjust the voltage (using a variable power supply), recording the different values of current on the ammeter. To ensure accurate measurements, the power should be turned off between each reading to prevent the temperature of the wire from affecting resistance. The resistance of the circuit should remain constant throughout the experiment. |

|                                             | Collaboratively students use their observations and scatterplot to draw conclusions about the relationship between voltage and current in a series or a parallel circuit. Students plot a graph of current (I) on the y-axis and voltage (V) on the x-axis. This graph will represent the directly proportional relationship between current and voltage (according to Ohm\'s law, V = IR), where the slope of the line will represent the constant resistance.                                                                                    |

|                                             | Students analyse the data using statistical measures and data displays to determine the impact that the introduction of the varicella (chickenpox) vaccination in 2005 has had on the rate of hospitalisation. Students will identify trends, patterns and relationships, and will present this as a written report or presentation.

Between 1994 and 2005, the mean was 137.6 cases per year. However, after the vaccine was added to the Australian National Immunisation Program, the rate dropped from 146 cases in 2006 to 85.8 in 2007. From 2007 to 2016, the mean was only 33.4 cases per year, representing a decrease of 104.2 cases compared to the pre-vaccine mean.                                                                                                                                    |

| **Possible teaching and learning activity** | When investigating the rate of chemical reactions, students apply understanding of rates to explain how concentration, surface area, temperature and catalysts affect the rate of reactions. The teacher conducts a short pre-assessment activity to determine student knowledge of rates. Student responses should inform the activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|                                             | The teacher clarifies that the rate of a reaction refers to how quickly a reaction occurs, typically measured by how much product is formed or how much reactant is used up over time. Students conduct a series of practical investigations to measure the rates of reactions. Students explain how concentration, surface area, temperature and catalysts affect the rate of reactions by describing the relationship between variables. For example:                                                                                            |

As the surface area of the marble chips increases (e.g. by using smaller chips or powder), the rate of reaction with hydrochloric acid also increases.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|                                             | The teacher guides students in graphing the rate of reactions. For example, when investigating how the surface area of marble chips affects the rate of reaction with hydrochloric acid, students can construct a graph to display the relationship based on their observations. The graph should plot the reaction rate on the y-axis (measured as volume of gas) and the elapsed time of reaction with the various surface areas of the marble chips on the x$-axis, highlighting how an increase in surface area leads to a faster reaction. |

## Strategies for supporting numeracy

Strategies for supporting numeracy should be selected based on the learning needs of each student. Examples of strategies are listed below.

-   Use mathematical terms while teaching and be explicit about their meaning: use mathematical terms from the NSW syllabuses in accordance with how they have been defined in the accompanying glossary (for example, ratio, scale). Be explicit about what the terms mean in relation to the subject. This reinforces understanding and supports students to connect key terms across different subjects.

-   Model numeracy strategies: model the steps to use when undertaking a process or solving a problem, describing each step as you go.

-   Create a positive classroom culture: encourage questions, perseverance and the value of learning from mistakes. Encourage students to share their thinking processes when using mathematical knowledge and provide opportunities for peer collaboration and support.

-   Use visual representations and digital tools: encourage students to use visual representations like diagrams, graphs and charts, and tools such as calculators, spreadsheets and graphing applications to explore concepts and solve problems.

### Supporting EAL/D learners

EAL/D learners may demonstrate varying levels of numeracy skill due to language and cultural considerations. Along with the strategies listed above, the following may be required:

-   enabling students to use their home language or dialect to build their field of understanding when discussing concepts and contexts related to numeracy

-   making connections between the grammatical structures of the English language typically used in mathematically worded problems and questions, and grammatical structures of their home language or dialect

-   using culturally relevant and familiar contexts to support understanding

-   building connections between familiar contexts and unfamiliar contexts.
