# Science 7–10

## Implementation from 2026

The new Science 7–10 Syllabus (2023) is to be implemented from 2026.

**2024 and 2025** – Plan and prepare to teach the new syllabus

**2026** – Start teaching new syllabus

School sectors are responsible for implementing syllabuses and are best placed to provide schools with specific guidance and information on implementation given their understanding of their individual contexts.

## Aim

The aim of the *Science 7–10 Syllabus* is to:

-   develop students' curiosity about, and interest in, science and the natural world

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   increase students' knowledge and understanding of the nature and practice of science, and the Working scientifically processes

```{=html}
<!– –>
```
-   encourage students to generate and analyse data, evaluate results, and make ethical, evidence-based decisions, as informed, reflective and scientifically literate citizens.

## Table of outcomes

*The table below displays the Science 7–10 focus areas and their associated outcomes. The relationship between Stage 4 and 5 and Life Skills outcomes is shown in the Related Life Skills column. Life Skills focus areas and their associated outcomes are listed in full in the Life Skills section of the syllabus.*
