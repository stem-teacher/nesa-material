# Science 7–10 (2023): Life Skills – Supporting students with the Working scientifically processes

The Working scientifically processes are an integral component of the *Science 7–10 Syllabus* and are embedded in outcomes and content. There are 8 Life Skills outcomes that correspond to the Working scientifically processes. Specific content for each of the Working scientifically processes has been included in the syllabus. Additionally, content related to Working scientifically processes is embedded in each Life Skills focus area and can be addressed with content from any other focus area.

## Prompt hierarchy

Using a system of prompts can support student engagement, participation and learning when working scientifically. This includes gestural, verbal, visual, modelling and physical prompts.

### Gestural prompts

Gestural prompts take the form of non-verbal cues to guide the learner towards the correct response.

Examples of providing support using gestural prompts include:

-   pointing to draw attention

-   positioning yourself near an object for interaction

-   using recognised hand signs, such as stop, thumbs up and thumbs down.

The gestures selected need to be appropriate for the expected response.

### Verbal prompts

Verbal prompts take the form of spoken language to guide the student. These can include questioning, explicit instructions and reminders.

### Visual prompts

Visual prompts take the form of images, symbols or written words to provide guidance. These are often presented on cards that can be arranged to further support sequencing.

### Model prompts

Model prompts involve the teacher demonstrating a task, with the student observing and then imitating the behaviour. To support cognitive load and memory when demonstrating extended tasks, the student copies each step before the next one is modelled.

### Physical prompts

Physical prompts include full physical assistance (prompting using hand-under-hand or hand-over-hand), partial assistance (guiding movement) and shadowing. Care should be taken that physical prompting does not limit the student's freedom of movement. Consent should be gained from the student before engaging in physical prompts.

## Least-to-most prompts

The prompt hierarchy below shows ways that prompts can be used when teaching content related to Working scientifically in order of the least-to-most level of support. The goal is to increase learning by choosing the least intrusive prompt necessary and by fading out the prompt as soon as possible. Not every prompt is appropriate for the type of response required. You may select or use prompts in combination to support student engagement and participation.

## Illustrations of practice using the prompt hierarchy

The following are examples of how the prompt hierarchy can be used to support students to participate in Working scientifically processes.

### Observing

Students can make observations using a range of senses, and non-digital tools and digital tools that aid the senses, such as magnifying glasses and cameras.

**Context:** the class has been learning about the features of living things with a focus on plants and animals.

**Syllabus content:**

-   Observe features of familiar living things (Cells and classification)

-   Use senses to make observations (Working scientifically)

**Suggested activity:** the teacher provides samples of leaves from different plants in the local environment. Students use their senses to observe the features of the leaves, such as shape (pointy, round, wide, narrow), texture (rough, smooth) and smell (strong, odourless).

  Gestural           Give students a leaf and gesture by pointing to use their hand or eyes to engage with the shape and texture.

  Verbal             Verbally instruct students to look at or touch the leaf to identify the shape and texture.

  Visual             Present a visual that incorporates symbols and/or images that represent 'smooth', 'round', 'shiny', 'pointy'. The student looks at or touches the leaf and selects the image to indicate what they have observed about the leaf.

  Model              Demonstrate step-by-step how to make observations of living things by showing students how to safely look at and touch leaves. Steps may be repeated to support student engagement and participation.

  Physical           Guide the student's finger using shadowing around the edge of the leaf. A student may be given hand-under-hand support to hold the leaf in their line of sight.

**Context:** the class has been learning about how to use scientific equipment when making observations of the features of living things.

**Syllabus content:**

-   Engage with tools and models to observe features of living things more closely (Cells and classification)

-   Use scientific equipment to make observations (Working scientifically)

**Suggested activity:** the teacher provides instruction on how to use microscopes when making observations. Students use a stereo microscope to make observations of the features of leaves.

  ––––––––– –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  Gestural           Point towards the various parts of the microscope to support the student to use a microscope to observe a leaf.

  Verbal             Offer verbal reminders of steps to follow when using a microscope to observe the surface of a leaf, such as 'first, place the leaf on the slide', 'place the slide on the stage', 'use the focusing dials to view the leaf'.

  Visual             Present a visual checklist to follow when using a microscope to make observations of the surface or shape of a leaf. This may include images and words related to setting up and using a microscope.

  Model              Model how to use a microscope to look at leaves. Demonstrate each step and then support the student to copy before progressing to the next step.

  Physical           Provide hand-over-hand support to use a microscope to make observations of a leaf.

### Questioning and predicting

**Context:** the class has been learning about forces in everyday life, including pushing, pulling, gravity and friction.

**Syllabus content:**

-   Interact with objects and predict what will happen when they are pushed, pulled, twisted or stretched (Forces)

-   Make predictions based on observations (Working scientifically)

**Suggested activity:** the teacher places a book on the table and asks students to make predictions about the direction a book will move when pushed across a table.

  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  **Prompt level**   **Examples of prompts**
  ––––––––– –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-
  Gestural           Extend arm left, right, up or down to support students to predict the direction of motion of the book based on the indicated force.

  Verbal             Verbally instruct students to make a prediction using if–then statements, such as 'if the book is pushed here, then ...'. Offer verbal reminders to students so they make a prediction about what will happen to the book due to the applied force.

  Visual             Provide visual clues to support predictions for what might happen to the book. For example, animations showing the book moving in various directions and coming to a stop, or continuing to move across the table.

  Model              Use visual aids such as laminated arrows to indicate the direction of force and the think aloud strategy to model a prediction. For example, if the book is pushed to the left by a medium force it will move to the left and then stop. Provide a scaffold for students to predict what will happen when the book is pushed.

  Physical           Encourage students to interact physically with the book and surface before making predictions. Provide hand-over-hand support to guide students to gently push the book on one side and observe its movement across the table. Use tape or markings on the table and hand-over-hand support to guide students to predict how far the book will travel when pushed in different directions, and placing their hand at the spot they think the book will stop. Encourage students to push the book gently and compare their prediction with the result.

  Gestural            Provide prompting for the sequencing activity by pointing to 2 or more cards or objects, and then asking students to select the next step in the sequence from these options.

  Verbal              Verbally describe the next step needed to investigate the effect of heat energy on solid ice. For example, 'Once we have collected our materials we then need to prepare the area by setting up equipment. Which card or object will you select for this step?'

  Visual              Provide a flow chart in the order that represents the correct sequence of steps to follow when conducting a safe investigation. Students match their cards or objects to the order represented in the flow chart.

  Model               Demonstrate each step of the activity. After each step is modelled, students identify the activity on a visual or tactile card, and then place these cards in the sequence they were demonstrated.

  Physical            Provide physical cards with visuals and words that describe each step of the investigation. Guide the student's hand as they place or point to the card with the first step. Incorporate body movements that represent each step and ask students to imitate the actions if appropriate. Ask 'what do we do next?', while incorporating visual prompts as necessary, and use hand-under-hand support to guide students to select and place the next card in the sequence.

  Verbal              Instruct students to select a mode to organise and represent the data using direct instruction, or open or closed questioning. For example, 'Select one of these options to organise and represent the data', 'How will you organise and represent the data?', 'Will you use tally marks or counters?'.

  Visual              Show students images and tactile examples of a range of representations of data, including graphs, tally marks and beads in containers, to prompt them to make their selection.

  Model               Demonstrate the selection of a mode for organising and representing the data using the think aloud strategy to describe reasoning and preferences, and visual cues, such as a large green tick, for the selected mode of data representation.

  Physical            Support students to select a mode to organise and represent data by guiding their hand to touch a visual or tactile symbol that represents their selected mode of organising and representing data.
