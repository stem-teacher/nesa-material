# Financial literacy

## The importance of financial literacy

Financial literacy includes a combination of financial knowledge, skills, attitudes and confidence that contribute to positive financial behaviours and money management decisions. 

Financial literacy provides students with the ability to make choices that suit their personal circumstances and take action to meet their financial goals. Financial literacy is associated with improved financial wellbeing and less financial stress.

Financial skills are supported by other NESA capabilities such as:

-   literacy

-   numeracy

-   critical and creative thinking.

The NSW K–10 Curriculum provides opportunities for students to develop financial knowledge, skills, attitudes and confidence with the aim of enhancing students' positive financial behaviour. Students develop an understanding of the following.
